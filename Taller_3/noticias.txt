{"0": "bahia cocoa review showers continued throughout the week in the bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early january and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, comissaria smith said in its weekly review. the dry period means the temporao will be late this year. arrivals for the week ended february 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. comissaria smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. with total bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. there are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +bahia superior+ certificates. in view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. comissaria smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for march shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. new crop sales were also light and all to open ports with june/july going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under new york july, aug/sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne fob. routine sales of butter were made. march/april sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. april/may butter went at 2.27 times new york may, june/july at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, aug/sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times new york sept and oct/dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times new york dec, comissaria smith said. destinations were the u.s., covertible currency areas, uruguay and open ports. cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for march/april, 785 dlrs for may, 753 dlrs for aug and 0.39 times new york dec for oct/dec. buyers were the u.s., argentina, uruguay and convertible currency areas. liquor sales were limited with march/april selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, june/july at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times new york july, aug/sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times new york sept and oct/dec at 1.25 times new york dec, comissaria smith said. total bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 crop. final figures for the period to february 28 are expected to be published by the brazilian cocoa trade commission after

act quickly on its proposed equity offering and would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor performance, banking analysts said. some analysts said they have recommended bankamerica delay its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be approved by the securities and exchange commission. bankamerica stock fell this week, along with other banking issues, on the news that brazil has suspended interest payments on a large portion of its foreign debt. the stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon, after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news. banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the first interstate bancorp <i> takeover bid gone, bankamerica is under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term. bankamerica filed the offer on january 26. it was seen as one of the major factors leading the first interstate withdrawing its takeover bid on february 9. a bankamerica

bankamerica's vice president for financial communications, when asked if bankamerica would proceed with the offer immediately after it receives sec approval. \"i'd put it off as long as they

outlook. although bankamerica has yet to specify the types of equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible preferred stock would encompass at least part of it. such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a lower conversion price and more dilution to bankamerica stock holders, noted daniel williams, analyst with sutro group. several analysts said that while they believe the brazilian debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to ease over the coming weeks. nevertheless, bankamerica, which holds about 2.70 billion dlrs in brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln dlrs if brazil pays no interest for a year, said joseph arsenio, analyst with birr, wilson and co. he noted, however, that any potential losses would not show up in the current quarter. with other major banks standing to lose even more than bankamerica if brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks. reuter ", "4":

pct over eurodollar rates, but venezuela requested easier terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year. it also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due to make in 1987, 1988 and

deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political dominance in washington, political analysts said. \"this is certification of incompetence,\" private political analyst stephen hess told reuters in commenting on the tower report made public today. \"it's as if he went before a professional licensing board and was denied credentials.\" in one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman john tower, a longtime reagan supporter and former republican senator from texas, told a press conference, \"the president clearly did not understand the nature of this operation.\" the report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in washington that reagan is not in full command of the government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared by a board of the republican president's own choosing. the three-member panel made up of tower, former national security adviser brent scowcroft and former secretary of state edmund muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism from a congress controlled by the democratic party. \"we're falling by our own hand,\" said one republican political strategist. \"what can we say except 'we're sorry, we won't do it again'?\" the strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988 presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said the report was like \"an anvil falling on us.\" hess, with the brookings institution public policy study group, said the report is the final blow to reagan's hopes of regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with congress, the press and the washington bureaucracy. the report may also undermine the standing of defense secretary caspar weinberger and secretary of state george shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping their own skirts clean than supporting the president. \"they protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. they were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences,\" it said. white house chief of staff donald regan and former central intelligence agency director william casey also received strong criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases. regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged for allegedly failing both to help reagan conduct the iran initiative and to avoid \"chaos\" in the disclosure process. casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous brain tumor in december, had already resigned for health reasons last month. \"this is a story about people who came up somewhat short of being heroes,\" tower told reporters. while reagan retains considerable constitutional powers, including command of the armed forces and the right to veto legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly with congress controlled by the democrats. the crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the man in the street will forsake reagan over the affair. although his job approval rating has fallen as much as twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms deal with iran became public last november, his personal popularity is still relatively high. a los angeles times poll released earlier this week showed that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought reagan was in control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was doing a good job as president. american enterprise institute analyst william schneider, a democrat, says reagan's loss of support among washington power brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public. \"in the past, he has been able to go around the power elite by appealing directly to the public,\" schneider said. reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised address next week. but one top republican strategist warned against expecting a dramatic turnaround. \"the white house has to avoid building expectations that cannot be met,\" said the strategist, who requested anonymity. \"they have to recognize there is no quick fix.\" analysts also point out that reagan's personal popularity has not always translated into public backing for his policies. they note he was dramatically rebuffed in last november's elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control of the senate to the democrats. reuter ", "28": "january housing sales drop, realty group says

presage lackluster real growth in the u.s. economy in the first quarter of 1987, economists said. with total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector, falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report painted a bleak picture for the u.s. economy. but they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital investment. \"it's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said david wyss of data resources inc. \"i'm particularly impressed by the 19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to tax reform than we thought.\" the commerce department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in office and computing equipment orders. economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws. \"it's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so people just aren't doing it as much,\" wyss said. increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws, economists said. november durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and december's increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported 0.9 pct. but most acknowledged that the huge january drop was caused by more than tax reform. \"the wash-out that took place in january was far greater than the actual gains that took place in november and december,\" said bill sullivan of dean witter reynolds inc. \"the economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year.\" \"the report definitely points to very sluggish capital spending over the next couple of quarters,\" said donald maude of midland montagu capital markets inc. maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. in november, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in december they fell 0.6 pct and in january 0.7 pct, he said. \"it suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which may quickly translate to a drop in production,\" midland montagu's maude said. wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of january's report, given that other reports have reflected strength. but he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51 pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in december. he also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in january shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in december. \"given these numbers, there's no reason for the fed to tighten,\" data resources' wyss said. \"but there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers like this. the fed will wait and

77 there was a tremendous shortage of newsprint. there were days when we didn't have enough paper to print the paper,\" peladeau said. \"when i lived that, i said to myself...next time we'll be ready.\" peladeau said most of donohue's current total newsprint capacity however, is already committed to other buyers. quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a year and maxwell's company, which publishes britain's daily mirror newspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes. peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49 pct owned by the new york times, (nyt.a), adding to donohue's 540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies will have to install another paper machine at amos, quebec, or build another mill to meet their demands . he said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint or other types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be on stream in two years. he said a mill in matane, a depressed area with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the government. peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures with maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market in france or in the u.s., where the company owns two large printing plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire. he said maxwell's sons, who are french citizens, would provide an entree into the french market, where foreigners are prevented from buying newspapers. peladeau said he would consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in france or the u.s. quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of about 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of two groups of weekly newspapers in the u.s., and is negotiating the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in canada, peladeau said. he said the company may consider starting daily newspapers in two small quebec cities and buying radio stations in the province. peladeau said quebecor may also consider trading in its listing on the american stock exchange for a new york stock exchange listing. reuter ", "79": "new york business loans fall 195 mln dlrs commercial and industrial loans on the books of the 10 major new york banks, excluding

some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock. american express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the market calculated a partially public shearson may command a good market value, thereby boosting the total value of american express. the rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend. american express closed on the new york stock exchange at 72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume. american express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity. analysts said comments by the company at an analysts' meeting tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes. at the meeting, company officials said american express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of shearson, according to analysts. yesterday, shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer, jeffery lane, to the added position of president, which had been vacant. it also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions. analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff. some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for american express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year. \"i think it is highly unlikely that american express is going to sell shearson,\" said perrin long of lipper analytical. he questioned what would be a better investment than \"a very profitable securities firm.\" several analysts said american express is not in need of cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset. but others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of shearson, and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market. larry eckenfelder of prudential-bache securities said he believes american express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past. \"shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place. shearson's book value is in the 1.4 mln dlr range. shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization,\" said eckenfelder. some analysts said american express could use capital since it plans to expand globally. \"they have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital. you want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road,\" said e.f. hutton group analyst michael lewis. \"they've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily in the future, which goes heavily

business by selling part of shearson, its stock might better reflect other assets, such as the travel related services business. \"it could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage. the value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company,\" he said. lewis said shearson

department and the office of management and budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a gao official told reuters. gao is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of sen. jesse helms (r-n.c.), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee. the report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid march. the cost of certificates, said the gao source, depends on the program's impact on the usda loan program. if gao determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up. however, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less. gao will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the gao official said. but a negative report on certificates \"will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh

foreign debt, finance minister manuel azpurua told a press conference. he declined to comment on meetings this week in new york between public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's 13-bank advisory committee except to say, \"they are progressing.\" azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil's decision to suspend payments, but each country must negotiate according to its own interest. asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditors today, which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over libor, azpurua said only, \"that is good news.\" according to banking sources, the banks' latest offer to venezuela is also a one pct margin as against the last february's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct venezuela wants. azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with the banks now: spread reduction, deferral of principal payments due in 1987 and 1988, lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment schedule, and debt capitalization schemes. azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in public and private debt principal this year. it was due to amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling, and pay 420 mln dlrs in non-restructured principal, both public sector. he said venezuela's original proposal was to pay no principal on restructured debt this year, but is now insisting that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank loans. the banking sources said the committee has been prepared to lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year, but that no direct commitment was likely on new loans. \"debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of financing is guaranteed,\" azpurua said. however, he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt payments, \"because circumstances change too quickly.\" at the same time, he said the government is presently studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private sector foreign debt, based on experience in other countries. the rules would be published by the finance ministry and the central bank. reuter ",

farm credit law passed by congress, the fca, as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted all its capital and needs federal government help. however, fca chairman frank naylor said because much of the system's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action, he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year and perhaps not even in 1988. the other republican member of

for resale to investors. naylor and beesley said a secondary market set-up outside the farm credit system would hurt the system. but beesley said a secondary market with the farm credit system as its

staff donald regan could signal the death knell to his white house tenure, but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top officials was less clear. regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert arms sales to iran and diversion of profits to nicaraguan rebels first emerged last november. but criticism of the roles of secretary of state george shultz and defense secretary caspar weinberger, who said they opposed the iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had been muted until the release of the tower commission report. \"their obligation was to give the president their full support and continued advice with respect to the program or, if they could not in conscience do that, to so inform the president,\" the report said after a three-month probe. \"instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program. they protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. they were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences of his personal commitment to freeing the hostages.\" the report saved some of its most scathing language for regan, a gruff former wall street executive and close personal friend of reagan whose autocratic rule in the white house angered some top reagan officials and, perhaps more importantly, reagan's wife nancy. \"more than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, he asserted personal control over the white house staff and sought to extend this control to the national security adviser,\" said the report. washington analysts said regan's departure now appeared to be only a matter of timing. many expected the president to announce it when he addresses the nation on the tower commission's findings next week. with regan's departure apparently imminent and poindexter and other key figures in the scandal already out of office, the report's tough criticism of shultz and weinberger could turn the spotlight on their future. senate republican leader robert dole, a key reagan ally, told reporters the report disclosed \"colossal blunders\" and said people who had not served the president well should step aside, but he did not specify who should go. \"it would seem to me that if you don't protect the president, you don't serve the president well, then you should move on,\" the kansas republican, a likely presidential candidate next year, said. one republican strategist said he believed regan would not be the only white house official to leave in the near future. reuter ", "178": "swiss economy in excellent condition, oecd says switzerland's economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the organisation for economic cooperation and development, oecd, said. this reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said. the oecd, in its annual report on switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern. the study forecast a decline in gross domestic product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985. but it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial nation oecd area. assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986. the faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to gdp would shrink in both years. but \"given switzerland's large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than gdp...which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances,\" the oecd said. real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted. in 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall gdp, it added. the outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said. as a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986. but the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange. the long-term appreciation of the swiss franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said. particularly for the banks, \"recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required ... to preserve its competitive position,\" it said. reuter ", "179": "u.s. wheat bonus to soviet called dormant the u.s. agriculture department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the soviet union under the export enhancement

companies are trying to get this fired up again,\" an aide to agriculture secretary richard lyng said. \"but there just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally.\" most analysts interviewed by

don't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process,\" the aide to lyng said. \"an export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,\" said one former usda official, who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling china wheat under the subsidy program. an official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within usda might be nudged along by members of congress, a number of whom urged usda this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the soviets. but lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to capitol hill yesterday, house members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time. the administration's interagency trade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer moscow wheat under the eep, officials at the u.s. trade representative's office said. in their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administration's previous eep offer but did not talk about any new initiative. one usda official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of \"calm, basic, factual economics.\" another usda official said there was \"not even an informal suggestion or hint\" that the soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms. usda and private sources agreed that consideration of an eep initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the white house stemming from the iran arms affair. reuter ", "180": "u.s. treasury part of argentine bridge loan the u.s. treasury said it was willing to participate with several other industrial countries in providing a 500

accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil. the weekly u.s. soybean crush rate was reported by the national soybean processors association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year. active soymeal export loadings at the gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number. however, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop south american soymeal over the next few months. u.s. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said. soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby march contract today. \"many speculators down here bought march soymeal and sold may, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause march to gain on deferreds),\" one cbt crush trader said. \"but they've been bailing out this week because the march has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month,\" he added. as a result of the weakness in soymeal, the march crush ratio (the value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days. the may crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level, the trader said. hopefully, they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added. with futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins. a central illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production, cash dealers said. most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. but processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins,

degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said. \"the numbers were a little disappointing, but i think we can take mr volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed,\" said bob bannon of security pacific national bank. fed chairman paul volcker told a congressional committee last thursday that the fed's policy \"has been unchanged up to today.\" although volcker's statement last thursday allayed most fears that the fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday. this need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since april of last year, economists added. today's data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said. \"the one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on wednesday,\" said dana johnson of first national bank of chicago. \"but there was a clearly justified need for them. there was nothing ominous.\" \"the fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new statement period today. if it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections,\" added security pacific's bannon. a fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the fed's discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln. for the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period. \"there were wire problems at two large banks on tuesday and wednesday, so i am not too bothered about the borrowings,\" said scott winningham of j.s. winningham and co. the wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said. \"for the time being, the fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct,\" said darwin beck of first boston corp. \"i expect it to continue in that vein.\" \"excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs,\" added first chicago's johnson. banks' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. after the fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward m-1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended february 16. looking ahead, economists said the fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar's progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy. \"the market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on fed policy,\" said first chicago's johnson. \"of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing.\" reuter ", "203": "federal industries launches eurobond issue <federal

inflation estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a 2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last september. finance minister edouard balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint. but trade union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises. and bank economists contacted by reuters said they believed prime minister jacques chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year, perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in presidential elections due by april 1988. \"the outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,\" said societe generale economist alain marais. \"we have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year.\" \"the big question is whether the government's policy of wage moderation will be maintained,\" he added. the government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity. but the head of the socialist cfdt union federation, edmond maire, meeting with chirac today, renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices. calling the government's policies \"unbalanced and unjust,\" he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. he announced after his meeting that chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training andre bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate force ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to chirac earlier in the week while the communist-led cgt, the largest of france's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority. but with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident chirac could resist union pay demands. \"salary indexation was ended by the previous socialist government and i dont think this administration is going to reverse that,\" commented michel develle, economist at recently-privatised banque paribas. damaging transport and electricity strikes over christmas and the new year, partly blamed by the government for higher inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he said. develle said paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7 per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent. \"but that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the second world war all french prices have been freed,\" he commented. finance ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in january living costs. but they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year. both marais and develle said they agreed with that, so long as the government kept wages under control. prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more than forecast this week by the national statistics institute, insee, marais said. but the second half year should be better, he added. ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit, several analysts said. so long as public sector wages are held down, higher value added tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth, they said. reuter ", "209": "gti corp <gti> 4th qtr oper net oper shr profit six cts vs loss two cts oper net profit 225,000 vs loss

largely responsible for vitalising the u.s. bond market in recent years, are now eyeing stockmarkets in the u.s., britain, france and hong kong, fund managers said. after concentrating on u.s. treasury bonds for years, japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on similar types of investments, they said. japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in 1986, shigeki matsumoto of nikko securities co ltd, said. matsumoto, who manages nikko's investment research and strategy, said there is evidence japanese investors began poking around in foreign stockmarkets around july last year, but few made firm commitments until december when net purchases suddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each of the previous five months. net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs, he added. this sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw the widest smiles from wall street because about 70 to 80 pct of funds will be invested in the u.s. markets, matsumoto said. \"the trend has been to head toward the u.s. market, first because of its size and next because it has been successful over the last couple of years,\" said eugene atkinson, managing director of goldman sachs international corp. wall street's massive turnover offers good liquidity, enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in and out of shares with the minimum of risk, he added. however, few see holdings in u.s. treasuries dwindling. they will remain a japanese mainstay, fund managers said. institutions, particularly life insurance companies which concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover payouts to policy holders, are unlikely to sell their u.s. treasuries, but will put in less money, said shinichi kobuse, manager of yamaichi securities co ltd's international fixed income activities. there has been some selling of u.s. bonds by short-term investors, but the selling is unlikely to amount to a significant chunk of japanese bond holdings because the liquidity of the u.s. bond market remains attractive, he added. kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the u.s. equity markets despite predictions by economists the u.s. economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months. interest in wall street has been spurred by recent reports of significant growth in earnings by major u.s. corporations, he added. yutaka hashimoto general manager of nippon life insurance co told an economic conference that insurance companies, which are responsible for 26 pct of japanese funds in foreign securities, hold a lopsided proportion of u.s. treasuries and intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies. insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their funds into the u.s., but will now invest in britain, west germany, france and other countries, hashimoto said. lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the strength in the yen, the growth in stock values is expected to offset currency risks, he added. one trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in u.s. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund investment stategies. the bank is looking more at u.s. equities and european bonds, he said. japanese investments in british equities have already turned active and the pace is likely to increase, said andrew sheaf, general manager of international equity activities at county securities japan. \"last week was the busiest week we had,\" he said. investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of british companies and the recent deregulation of government controlled firms, fund managers said. deregulation in france is also attracting japanese interest, but stock investments there will be inhibited by worries about the french franc, they said. investments in hong kong will be mostly short-term and speculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term political stability, they added. japanese investors are cautious about west germany,

is now expected to make no contribution to australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87, ending june 30, while net exports will account for all of the overall increase, treasurer paul keating said here. however, he did not say in his speech to the economic planning advisory council (epac) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised. but keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth. the august budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points. keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated. \"the government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion,\" he said. partial indicators released since the last meeting of epac in december indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track, keating said. \"they indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time,\" he said. \"on the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment.\" keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct. \"nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane,\" he said. keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand. he said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income. the moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year. \"the current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88,\" keating said. \"as the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further, and given continued effective wage restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,\" he said. reuter ", "227": "thai rice exports rise in week ended february 24

export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. the special meeting of the international coffee organization (ico) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. however, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. world coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the international coffee agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut brazil\"s output by nearly two thirds. brazil is the world\"s largest coffee producer and exporter. producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said. tempers flared late saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. the big producers \"want to have the ball only in their court and it isn\"t fair,\" minority producer spokesman luis escalante of costa rica said. the majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas april 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before september 30, delegates said. their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, colombia 17 pct, ivory coast seven pct and indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters. but consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. their proposals would give brazil a smaller quota share and colombia and indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said. delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. \"anything is possible at this phase,\" even adjournment of the meeting until march or april, one said. if the ico does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said. retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even

not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain,\" the report says. \"the modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels.\" constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines. the fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as \"wereng\" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields. the outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types. the government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices. palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says. but while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (oct-sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant. the report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last september\"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand. the report said that indonesia\"s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. it compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984. the dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump. reuter ", "235": "kuwait says no plans for emergency opec talks kuwait\"s oil minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency opec meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices. sheikh ali al-khalifa al-sabah was quoted by the local daily al-qabas as saying: \"none of the opec members has asked for such a meeting.\" he denied kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation. traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate opec is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in geneva last december. they named kuwait and the united arab emirates, along with the much smaller producer ecuador, among those producing above quota. kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd. \"this rumour is baseless. it is based on reports which said kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. they suppose that because kuwait has the ability, it will do so,\" the minister said. sheikh ali has said before that kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd. \"if we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in kuwait are unusually clever,\" he said. he was referring apparently to the gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by opec last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel. prices in new york last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel. sheikh ali also delivered \"a challenge to any international oil company that declared kuwait sold below official prices.\" because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate. however, kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added. he reaffirmed that the planned meeting march 7 of opec\"s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of april at the request of certain of the body\"s members. ecuador\"s deputy energy minister fernando santos alvite said last wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted opec to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec\"s pricing committee. referring to pressure by oil companies on opec members, in apparent reference to difficulties faced by qatar, he said: \"we expected such pressure. it will continue through march and april.\" but he expected the situation would later improve. reuter ", "236": "indonesia seen at crossroads over economic change indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the u.s. embassy says in a new report. to counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. indonesia, the only asian member of opec and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year\"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in september. but the u.s. embassy report says president suharto\"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy. \"(it) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,\" the report says. it primarily assesses indonesia\"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country\"s general economic performance. it says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, \"there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.\" \"this group strongly favours an import substitution economy,\" the report says. indonesia\"s economic changes have been welcomed by the world bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies. three sets of measures have been announced since last may, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. the report says indonesia\"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. \"this is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s,\" the report notes. indonesia, the largest country in south-east asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in april. but the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. \"for 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.\" \"growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture,\" the report states. bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs. a new world bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the bank

defence expenditure in the hindu-majority nation where playing on fear of aggression by moslem pakistan has proved a vote winner. the indian express, the country\"s biggest selling paper, said: \"the defence cow has never been holier.\" the sunday mail newspaper branded the budget \"shamelessly political.\" it said in a front page commentary the \"budget is bad for growth, bad for prices, bad for

education outlays but he ordered a hold-down on current expenditure in an attempt to rein in the budget deficit. he told ministries to curb spending and promised a review of money-losing public sector industries. gandhi lowered import tariffs on some computer parts but otherwise did little to extended the economic liberalisation policy launched two years ago. reaction in bombay, india\"s business capital, was generally unfavourable. businessmen and economists said the budget had no proposals for closing the 1987/88 budget deficit. it also failed to boost industrial investment and productivity needed to lift real economic growth above the five pct a year envisaged by the 1985-90 development plan. nalin vissanji, president of the indian merchants chambers of commerce said the budget gave no incentives to the capital market and had not fulfilled a government pledge to remove surtax on corporate income. shares on the bombay stock exchange, india\"s biggest, fell in a post-budget session yesterday but brokers welcomed gandhi\"s proposal to set up a regulatory board for the securities industry. the exchange was shaken last year by several scandals and trading was suspended several times. brokers said trading volume may increase with the change in capital gains tax on stock sales. stockholders can now sell shares after one year instead of three years without incurring capital

announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a deficit of 5.472 billion riyals. the deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86. in a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today, finance and petroleum minister sheikh abdul-aziz bin khalifa al-thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. sheikh abdul-aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. the government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues. sheikh abdul-aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15 pct. he urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. he did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. sheikh abdul-aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country's foreign reserves. he added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings, social services,

"gulf bond, stock markets lag behind, gib says gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, <gulf international bank bsc> (gib) said. the bank's economist henry azzam said in a review of gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals. \"greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts,\" he said. the gib study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. azzam said gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. \"nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind,\" he said. most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. only kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. but with dwindling financial surpluses in the gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, azzam said. he said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had \"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region.\" in addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. a sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. he called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of gulf cooperation council (gcc) states -- bahrain, kuwait, qatar, oman, saudi arabia and the united arab emirates (uae). some moves had been taken in this direction, with bahrain allowing gcc nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. azzam said gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in saudi arabia. but he added there is \"no bond market to speak of\" in saudi arabia, qatar, oman or the uae, with the last saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. while bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in saudi arabia has picked up, establishment of

market oil prices, nazer said saudi arabia \"is fully adhering by the ... accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.\" nazer, quoted by spa, said recent pressure on free market prices \"may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market.\" saudi arabia was a main architect of the december accord, under which opec agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. the agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets, which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs. nazer was quoted by

agriculture ministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cuts in prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protests by european farmers, community officials said. the common target for the farmers' wrath is the ec's brussels commission, which for the fourth year running has called for radical changes in the price support system. ec agriculture commissioner frans andriessen says huge food surpluses, which have alienated international trade partners and pushed the community to the edge of bankruptcy, demand such action. with community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnes of unwanted cereals, over one mln tonnes of butter and huge stocks of wine and olive oil, andriessen says bluntly the days of open-ended price guarantees must end. ec agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed prices paid to community farmers before an april 1 deadline for the new marketing year, an increasingly difficult task as ec members cut funds and demand greater budget discipline. andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices, coupled with reductions in other support mechanisms, which could lead to price cuts of as much as eight pct for some products. a producer's right to sell into ec warehouses at a fixed guaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to be scaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases. the latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure on agriculture virtually stable. ec farm policies now swallow two-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion european currency units (ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected shortfall this year of about five billion ecus. the most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils and fats tax and a change in the \"green\" exchange rate system, which translates ec farm prices into national currencies. the tax, of up to 330 ecus per tonne, would be levied on imported and domestically produced oilseeds, but could trigger a fresh trade dispute with the united states, which provides the ec with the bulk of its soybeans. it would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat products in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter consumption. west germany has flatly rejected green rate changes, which would cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with weak and strong currencies were brought more into line. reuter ", "263": "qantas

including a 300 mln mark private placement for deutsche bank. issues for all of february rose to nearly five billion marks, from 3.6 billion in january. the heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very best addresses were having to accept higher coupons. \"i think the d-mark market is still good, but only if you can give a good coupon,\" another manager said. but even some government borrowers were not getting the best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more readily under other conditions. of the three mark eurobonds launched on tuesday alone, bonds for den danske bank and iceland were trading outside fees on friday, although prices had recovered from initial lows. den danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on friday at 97.35/65 compared with its par price, and iceland's 6-1/2 pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price. a 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for nippon telegraph and telephone was also depressed, but traded friday

its 99-1/2 price, thanks mainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said. the large amount of paper brought to the market in the last two months has also led many syndicate managers to complain about the bundesbank's present fixed calendar system, which they say is too inflexible. currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be registered with the bundesbank in the week preceding the two-week issue period. a bank may decline to issue a bond on the requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the next calendar period to schedule the bond again. some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system. the bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks from four weeks last july. but few expect the calendar to be completely abolished. \"i don't think the bundesbank would give that up,\" one banking analyst said. \"i wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system,\" the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the volume of new issues themselves. the bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar without trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through the euromarket, he said. for this reason, few managers here foresee the bundesbank sacrificing its present calendar system. bond activity in west german bond trading and syndication departments is also

domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, but the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of public bond issues, they said. \"relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only to straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds and warrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from

planned for january 1988. \"nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the end of his administration, which is not only impossible but also is very irresponsible as a politican,\" rei shiratori, professor of politics at dokkyo university, told reuters. \"nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as parliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer,\" shiratori said. some ruling liberal democratic party (ldp) members of parliament have spoken against the tax, which nakasone says is needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes. nakasone today called for disciplinary action against ldp members who oppose the tax. \"there are some who are objecting because of their constituencies,\" he told a meeting of government and party leaders. \"if the party discipline is broken, i would like to see punishment considered.\" \"a proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partly because nakasone breached his election pledge against introducing it,\" shiratori said. \"moreover, the tax is being introduced when the public feels uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's appreciation and about the future when the japanese society is rapidly aging,\" he said. political analysts said the controversial tax could affect the more than 2,500 local elections scheduled for april, involving governors, mayors, town and village heads and assemblies at all levels. but the situation is complicated, since opposition parties excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with the ldp, the political analysts added. shiratori said, \"in the worst case, implementation of the sales tax, now scheduled for next january, may be put off for some time before the government makes a final decision. \"another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to perhaps three pct. \"a third alternative for the government is to ram through the bills only with the attendance of ldp mps,\" he said. seizaburo sato, professor of

boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. members of the seven-member kuala lumpur-based atpc account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output. under the atpc plan, malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, indonesia 24,516, thailand 19,000, bolivia 13,761, zaire 1,736 and nigeria 1,461. australia has said it is not setting any export quota. however, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year. comment from officials in zaire was unavailable. mine officials in malaysia, the world's leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started march 1. chief inspector of mines redzuan sumun told reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. mine owners in malaysia have welcomed the atpc export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. more than 100 applications for licences are pending. redzuan said the mines department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. atpc chairman and indonesia's mining and energy minister subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. a spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company pt tambang timah told reuters it would be easy for indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636. in bangkok, thai industry minister pramual sabhavasu said thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. to insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter thailand smelting and refining co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said. the thai mineral resources department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said. but mining industry council president dam teutong told reuters that

expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota. mining minister jaimie villalobos told reuters in la paz that bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. he said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of october 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of bolivia's total exports. he said there were risks in the atpc plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. he did not elaborate. mines, power and steel minister bunu sheriff musa said in lagos that nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its atpc quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. industry sources told reuters that nigeria's output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year. atpc officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. the atpc officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. they added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the atpc's discretion. the atpc would have produced and exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. non-members brazil and china have pledged to cooperate with the atpc and limit

miguel corp> (smc) may follow the philippine government's appointment of a well-known banker to the smc board, investment analysts said. they told reuters the presence of <united coconut planters bank> (ucpb) president ramon sy to the board of smc may mean changes in smc management, which for decades was controlled by the family of its president, andres soriano. sy was appointed by a government commission that controls 51 pct of san miguel's stock, after another nominee resigned. the presidential commission on good government (pcgg) holds six seats on the 15-member smc board, which represent 33.13 mln sequestered shares. the stocks were seized on suspicion that they were owned by eduardo cojuangco, then chairman of ucpb and san miguel. he was a close associate of deposed president ferdinand marcos, and he left the country after marcos's fall. before the seizure, soriano led a 3.3 billion peso bid for the shares, paying ucpb a 500 mln peso deposit. the bid valued the shares at about 100 pesos. they traded at 93 pesos today, down from 95.50 at friday's close. finance secretary jaime ongpin told reporters on saturday that sy would definitely sit on the smc board despite the objections of some directors associated with soriano. \"i don't think there is a conflict of interest as such,\" he said. \"i was potentially concerned with seeing a situation where you have a contentious atmosphere on the board. but sy has assured (the government) that he does not intend to behave in a contentious manner,\" ongpin added. the soriano group cited conflict of interest in opposing sy's directorship. its lawyer said in a letter to the pcgg that a pending suit seeking forfeiture of smc's 500 mln peso deposit and major undisclosed damages against the brewery represented a clear conflict. ucpb, however, sought board representation before sy's appointment, petitioning the pcgg \"so that the interests of the owners of the 33 mln shares would be adequately protected.\" investment analysts polled by reuters said the ucpb had a right to a slot on the smc board as trustee for coconut farmers who claim ownership of the disputed shares. the analysts said sy, backed by the government, would probably suggest replacements for pcgg nominees expected to resign soon in keeping with a new law prohibiting government officials from working for private companies. smc's annual election is scheduled for may. a ucpb spokesman declined to comment, saying it was up to the pcgg to decide whom to appoint. one analyst said objections were understandable from the family that founded the company 97 years ago. \"it is a natural instinct of self-preservation for soriano,\" he said. smc posted a net income of 448.8 mln pesos in 1985 on net sales of 10.99 billion

large deficit will push up india's moderate inflation rate and that the country's stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty, economists, politicians and stockbrokers told reuters. the projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88, ending march, is 56.88 billion rupees, down from an upwardly revised estimate of a record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87. the projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87, based on wholesale prices, is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86. economists pointed out that the government itself had expressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87 economic survey report published last week. presenting the budget to parliament on saturday, prime minister gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed to trim large non-development expenditures. the deficit for 1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure, he said. but few analysts have taken gandhi's assurance seriously. they say the deficit more than doubled in 1986/87 from an initial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees. lal krishna advani, president of the opposition bharatiya janata party, said gandhi's failure to mention specific measures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices. economists said increased liquidity in the economy, as reflected by expansion of the m3 aggregate money supply, may cause prices to rise. the survey report showed the m3 rose by 15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of 1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86 period. economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects, after bad weather last year, may strain prices further. economists said the deficit would also cause the government to rely increasingly on internal borrowing. market loans and bonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88, up from the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion. no reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes, which will discourage savings, economists said. avinash purulkar, chief manager of the state-owned union bank of india, said the annual inflation rate may double to around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency notes to cover the deficit. brokers said stock market investors have started selling long-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in the budget that reduces the holding period required to claim exemption from the capital gains

present hectic selling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on the scene. \"just now there is acute nervousness in the market,\" he said. brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to help

measures in hungary hungary is to embark on a new series of austerity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled last year after quadrupling in 1985. the target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by parliament last december was 43.8 billion forints. but zoltan boesze, chief of the finance ministry's budget financing division, told reuters the government now saw this as too high and had decided \"quite severe\" measures were needed. \"all the organizations of economic management have been charged with elaborating further (savings) measures,\" he said. asked if these measures were being taken under pressure from the international monetary fund (imf), boesze said: \"the fund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results, and of course the fund would support these efforts.\" imf teams spent several weeks in budapest late last year. boesze said preliminary figures showed that hungary's state budget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984. the economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints because of poor performance by state firms, which needed subsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency. the exact extent and nature of savings are still under discussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest budget item -- must definitely fall, boesze said. subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain low consumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164 billion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985. parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints. \"i think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the former situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies,\" boesze said. \"the central administration must be hard. ... if we are not hard then we will not be successful.\" boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve provisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and 800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities. \"i believe these reserves should not be used at all,\" he said. wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic product, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct. the authorities had already signalled a small fall in real wages for 1987, but boesze said firms will suffer severe tax penalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct. this would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retail price inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986. a four-month basic wage freeze expires on april 1. about 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and 33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices. boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant cuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations made this difficult. but he added: \"i think ultimately we will be able to make curtailments in subsidies in this area as well.\" he said hungary plans to introduce price reform at the beginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and value added tax. the imf supports these aims. hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last september in an attempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms. between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to be unemployed at least temporarily by 1990. labour discipline is being tightened and firms may fire workers more easily. boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state by firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to shed labour. he gave no exact figures. istvan nagy, a senior finance ministry official responsible for drafting the bankrupcy law, told reuters last year he hoped the law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct. after subsidies to state enterprises, the largest single budget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved for 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion). interest payments on international debt are set to rise to more than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven billion in 1986, boesze said. hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year to 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, while trade with western countries plunged into a deficit of more than 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two years earlier. boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pct by credits from the national bank, mostly from abroad, and 10 pct by the issue of domestic state bonds. deputy prime minister frigyes berecz told hungarian economists in a speech this month that the country's economy was in a \"very difficult\" situation, but not in crisis. there would have to be a turnround with tangible results this year, however, and borrowing must be used more effectively. \"any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous,\" berecz said. reuter ", "335": "u.k. money market shortage forecast revised down the bank of

half the size of the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with almost no loss of sound quality. this aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape piracy and loss of royalties. in negotiations that delayed the dat player's debut, the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry be built into the machines. machines sold in japan are fitted with a computer chip to prevent copying through a digital signal. but copies can still be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier. \"nobody can tell the difference,\" one salesman said. dat players have been kept off western markets and some countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. but japanese hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a profitable niche. prices of dat players will probably fall quickly, possibly to around 70,000 yen by next year as other makers put their products on the market, industry analysts said. they said by 1990, sales could reach six mln units per year. philips of the

italy's leading economists and a professor at rome university. according to spaventa, these violent swings of mood have been occurring for the last 15 years, with italy one minute seen as the \"bad boy of europe\" and unable to raise a dollar and the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration, \"i think there's a lot of exaggeration...once it used to be the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign newspapers flocked to italy to study this. that was another story about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a dark room.\" spaventa, in tune with other economists and industrialists here, stress italy's recent achievements, particularly the dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial enterprises, but warns that the economy is still vulnerable. profits of private sector firms such as fiat s.p.a., <fiat.m> and <ing. c. olivetti and c. s.p.a.> are booming, the major state industries are back in the black after years of losses, inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of payments deficits have been slashed. expectations by some experts that italy is poised to replace britain as the world's fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism. italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it feels to be its second-rate status among the major industrialised countries. only this week, it angrily demanded clarification of this status after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers from the group of five (g-5) - comprising the united states, japan, west germany, france and britain. italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an agreement reached in tokyo last year to let italy and canada attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned managing the international monetary system. but italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems still facing its economy, economists and industrialists say. \"we must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy,\" warns fiat managing director cesare romiti. he says that while italy's recent achievements are indeed cause for satisfaction and optimism, the focus now should be on the problems still remaining rather than those already solved. the country's huge state sector deficit, high unemployment and a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most worrying problems, experts say. the size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at 109,561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100,000 billion lire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiral again, says carlo scognamiglio, head of the private luiss university in rome. inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a decade in september 1984 and by january this year was running at 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guarantee international competiveness, economists and industrialists say. and unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally last october according to the latest official data. recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 million people seeking work in october 1986, almost 73 pct were aged between 14 and 29. unemployment in the south was running at 17.7 pct, more than double that in the industrial north. the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) recently forecast that italian gross domestic product (gdp) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pct in 1986. but it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to check rising unemployment. another problem is italy's reliance on imported raw materials. the country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs. this factor actually worked sharply in italy's favour last year, when lower energy costs helped slash the country's trade deficit to 3,717 billion lire by year end from 23,085 billion lire in 1985. but economists say the improvement owes little to any structural change in the italian economy and that any reversal of the trend in costs could have serious consequences. if italy truly wants to be counted among the world's top industrialised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarket operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality information about their activities, economists say. italy has no controls on insider trading. the country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements controls -- a european community directive calls for these to be dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a less blinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating procedures, economists say. \"even today, if i wanted to invest in the tokyo bourse, i doubt i'd find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in banks which would allow me to do that,\" says spaventa. reuter ", "340": "u.k. money market receives 37 mln stg assistance the bank of england said it had provided

the u.s. kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other. the talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of u.s./japan economic relations, will pave the way for american secretary of state george schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from china. faced with growing congressional protectionist pressure, the u.s. administration is pressing japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, u.s. officials said. \"we appreciate their frustration,\" a senior japanese government official said. \"but we are also frustrated.\" the official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. that has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said. he said the u.s. administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with congress. \"it would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments,\" a senior u.s. official replied. the talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in japan's favour. on the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. the structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits. these talks come at a particularly delicate time for the japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. some u.s. officials complained japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as washington wants. japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge u.s. budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. that budget deficit has meant that the u.s. is buying more imports. japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. \"it condemns japan without due process,\" one japanese official said. that reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by democratic senator lloyd bentsen, he said. japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the u.s., officials said. nevertheless, japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them. \"we have no leverage,\" one official admitted. as a result, tokyo is striving to meet u.s. complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers. the u.s. is pressing for greater access to the japanese super computer market. the japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential

100 tonnes between august and october last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of the ec market if they continue at the same pace. the industry said the mercury was being sold at more than 40 pct

proposed growth facility. ongpin acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics. \"secretary monsod and i get along famously,\" he said. \"she talks and i listen but i don't necessarily agree.\" monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridging the financing gap would have aided the government's pump-priming program and 1987/92 medium-term development plan. she said if private sector investment continued to be held back by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and rising interest rates, the country would fail to achieve its gross national product (gnp) growth target of an average 6.5 pct over the next six years. \"if you don't get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan. how can there be a program if there is no finance?\" she said, adding ongpin's stand was not good

american express' 1.25 billion dlr net in 1986. american express' ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of shearson would bring. analysts speculated that all of shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs. to some however, the need for added capital is puzzling. \"(american) express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to,\" said larry eckenfelder of prudential-bache securities. analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of shearson management wednesday. chief operating officer jeffrey lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president. the reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts speculated would allow shearson to be a stand alone company. analysts, contacted on sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week's market speculation. it does confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which unsuccessfully attempted to expand shearson with a major acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition. late last year, shearson's takeover offer to the e.f. hutton group inc was rejected by hutton, and analysts said there had been speculation that shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major wall street brokerage. reuter ", "362": "spanish farmers protest, then call truce spanish farmers demanding a better deal from the european community blocked roads and staged protest rallies this

with a net gain worth 905 mln swiss francs, the finance ministry said. the surplus, including cash transactions and long-term investments, contrasted with the 1985 shortfall of 1.06 billion francs and the 297 mln franc deficit proposed in the 1986 budget. all categories of revenues were higher than forecast, and expenditures were 433 mln francs under forecast. the finance ministry said expenditures totalled 23.18 billion francs against 22.88 billion in 1985 and the 23.61 billion proposed in the original 1986 budget. tax receipts, at 25.11 billion, were well above the 1985 figure of 22.19 billion and the forecast for 1986 of 23.71 billion. this left a surplus on cash transactions totalling 1.94 billion francs against a forecast 102 mln and the 1985 deficit of 696 mln. income and wealth taxes ended 749 mln francs above forecast, 378 mln of which came from higher than expected receipts on the stamp duty on financial market transactions. taxes on comsumption brought in 638 mln francs more than planned and other taxes 16 mln francs more, the ministry said. the ministry said the improvement in the overall account reflected years of efforts by the government and parliament to introduce saving and the acceptance by people of necessary tax increases. but economic factors, including the low rate of inflation, the weak dollar, falling interest rates and low oil prices were also important factors. a spokesman for the ministry said the government had used its improved cash position to retire about one billion francs of government debt, which accounted for the difference

one megabyte of memory, expandable to eight megabytes. it can be equipped with a 12-inch monochrome or a 13-inch color monitor. in a demonstration of its speed and power, company executives said they

bankamerica corp's <bac> bank of america unit last week issued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card receivables via sole manager first boston. dub said the offering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors. the bank of america offering followed a january 16 issue of 200 mln dlrs of similar debt by republicbank corp's <rpt> republicbank delaware unit. goldman, sachs and co ran the books on that deal, with first boston acting as co-manager. however, dub said the bank of america securities were more closely related to the so-called \"cars deals\" that raced to market last year than were the republicbank securities. \"the republicbank issue was secured by credit card receivables. in contrast, the bank of america deal was the first public offering of credit card receivables because we used a grantor trust vehicle,\" he said. in a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest in the trust, analysts explained. the bank of america certificates were issued by california credit card trust a, which the bank established for that single purpose, investment bankers pointed out. the debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in 1992. first boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over comparable treasury securities. non-callable for life, the deal was rated aaa by both moody's and standard and poor's. underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the bank of america deal was priced too aggressively. \"aaa-rated auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over treasuries when first boston priced the deal,\" one said. however, dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway. the first boston executive attributed this to the deal's top-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year's cars deals, which were rated by s and p alone. \"investors receive interest only payments for the first 18 months and then interest and principal payments for the remaining five to seven months,\" dub detailed. investment bankers pointed out that because the bank of america deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals that were brought to market late last year. the collateral for the trust includes a pool of visa credit card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. bank of america has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making it one of the biggest in the u.s., analysts said. last week's deal was

administration tattered by the iran-contra arms scandal. reagan and former senate republican leader howard baker, whose appointment as white house chief of staff won bipartisan praise, will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade u.s. arms with iran for help in freeing ameican hostages in lebanon. among the chores facing reagan's new inner circle is assessing the damage the 300-page tower commission report has done to the nomination of robert gates to succeed william casey as the new head of the central intelligence agency. white house officials are checking to see how much support gates, a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat, would have if his nomination is submitted to the full senate for a vote, senate republican leader robert dole said. appearing on the nbc news program, \"meet the press,\" the kansas senator said the gates nomination \"could be in some difficulty.\" aides said that gates' future would be given high priority by baker. even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms sale scandal, lawmakers said senate confirmation of the gates nomination is not assured and, even if won, would come only after months of congressional probes into the affair. \"he has the smell of iran on him,\" said former nevada sen. and reagan confidant paul laxalt. \"he is a victim.\" laxalt, appearing on the abc news program, \"this week with david brinkley,\" bluntly admitted \"the gates nomination is in trouble.\" senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn said the odds are now slightly against confirmation of gates. when asked on the syndicated television program, \"john mclaughlin: one on one,\" if he thought gates would be confirmed, the georgia democrat shot back: \"i wouldn't bet any money on it. \"i think this report hurts that,\" nunn said. \"it indicates that the national security council had policy-type influence over intelligence-type activities and we're going to go into that with mr. gates. only a day after it was issued last week, the tower report prompted the abrupt exit of donald regan as white house chief of staff. regan, the former wall street executive and treasury secretary who has been the president's top aide for the past two years, was assigned the lion's share of the blame for the botched handling of the iran arms sale. the report blamed regan for the \"chaos that descended on the white house\" since it was first revealed last november that profits from the iran arms sales had been diverted to contra rebels fighting the leftist nicaraguan government. the two other victims of the scandal are former national security adviser vice adm. john poindexter who resigned and marine lt. col. oliver north who was fired after it was disclosed last november 23 that profits from the iran arms sale were diverted to the contras. the two, pictured by the tower commission as the key operators of the iran arms deal, have refused to testify. reagan, who freely admits disliking details, is portrayed in the tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy. that perception has wrecked reagan's popularity and threatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leaves office in january 1989. a recent newsweek magazine poll found that just 40 pct of americans approved of reagan's leadership, a record low, and a third believed he should consider resignation. after meeting with aides over the weekend and poring over the meaty report of the commission headed by former texas sen.

existing structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt, finance minister dilson funaro said. u.s. banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of brazil's debt to banks, he said, adding \"this is not fair with the european and japanese banks.\" the committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983, however. noting the often different reactions of u.s., japanese and european banks, funaro told journalists that brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions. since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis, \"perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors,\" central bank president francisco gros said. brazil on february 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs. funaro and gros spent two days at the end of last week in washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit britain, france, west germany, switzerland and italy for discussions with governments. funaro and gros are today meeting british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson, foreign secretary geoffrey howe and governor of the bank of england robin leigh-pemberton. bankers have estimated that brazil owes u.k. banks around 8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the u.k. the third largest exposure after the u.s. and japan. the crisis began when brazil's trade surplus, its chief means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country's\u007fate of inflation. reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs. funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems with brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only partial servicing of the debt. \"what we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance for part of the service, because we cannot service all that,\" he said. \"i really think we have to change the old rules.\" asked why brazil was first approaching governments, rather than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a solution to the crisis, funaro said \"we must first talk to the governments and then we can talk to the banks, because the banks have some limits.\" \"it is a political discussion from our point of view,\" he said. funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to japanese and canadian government officials. he would then talk to the commercial banks \"if i've got some solution from the governments. i can't take the burden only to the banks.\" he was not sure how long it would take to reach a solution. \u007f in discussions with governments brazil would review the mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in need. finance from official lending agencies had been virtually closed since 1982. \"you must open these mechanisms,\" he said. he said that while the u.s. officials had been disturbed by brazil's suspension of interest payments, they understood brazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves. also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed \"because we can't stay as we were the last few years.\" \"i'm trying to put the problem on the table.... all of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium.\" he said. although brazil has rejected a substantive role for the international monetary fund (imf) in managing its economy, funaro paid a call in washington to imf managing director michel camdessus and to world bank president barber conable. funaro noted that inflation in february had started to decline again and he expected brazil to achieve a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplus in 1987. banking sources noted that brazil's monthly surplus had declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last year, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months. brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world, funaro said, although its share of international trade was only one pct. \"the solution is linked with growth, not recession,\" he said, noting an imf program would involve promoting exports and inducing an internal recession in order to service debt. banking sources said brazil's debts to foreign governments, as opposed to commercial banks, now benefit from a sounder structure following last month's rescheduling by the paris club of creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt. reuter ", "419": "whittaker corp <wkr> 1st qtr jan 31 net oper shr 17 cts vs 25 cts qtly div 15 cts vs 15 cts prior oper net 1,522,000 vs 3,501,000 sales

negotiations on brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter for the commercial banks themselves, a treasury spokesman said. the spokesman said the chancellor had emphasised in talks this morning with funaro the need for the brazilian authorities to be able to present a convincing economic program to the country's creditors. he added an accord with the international monetary fund (imf) could be a very helpful support. brazil on february 20 suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks. lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a clear rebuff to brazilian hopes of obtaining official cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis. funaro, accompanied by central bank president francisco gros, is on the first leg of a tour of european capitals in an attempt to explain to governments brazil's indefinite suspension of interest payments earlier this month. brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the imf in managing its economy, arguing that an imf austerity program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption would lead to recession and threaten democracy. funaro and gros last week visited washington as part of their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts to change the means by which developing countries finance growth. funaro said on saturday in washington that brazil would not have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and faster financing from international agencies. he said earlier today that brazil was first approaching governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves about the interest payment moratorium \"because the banks have some limits.... it's a political discussion from our point of view.\" funaro said on friday that his talks with u.s. officials had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve brazil's debt crisis, describing the meeting as an initial contact. he had earlier met federal reserve board chairman paul volcker and u.s. treasury secretary james baker. the treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks had been at funaro's request. after travelling this week to france, germany, switzerland and

the company by 1.50 dlrs a share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities. in a filing with the securities and exchange commission, redstone, who controls dedham, mass.,-based national amusements inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash portion of its viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs. redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs. the redstone offer, which is being made through arsenal holdings inc, a national amusements subsidiary set up for that purpose, which also give viacom shareholders one-fifth of a share of arsenal common stock after the takeover. viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids from redstone and mcv holdings inc, a group led by viacom management which is competing with redstone for control of the company and already has a formal merger agreement with viacom. the company did not disclose the details of the revised offers, but said a special committee of its board would review them later today. the redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in viacom, and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for at least half of the outstanding stock. the two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements, which give them access to viacom's financial records provided they keep the information secret. in his sec filing, redstone, who estimated his cost of completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said bank of america is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs. besides the financing it would raise through a bank syndicate, bank of america has also agreed to provide a separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs, redstone said. merrill lynch, pierce fenner and smith inc has increased its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated financing debt for the viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs it agreed to underwrite earlier, redstone said. redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln dlrs in equity toward the takeover. the redstone equity contribution to the takeover would consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 viacom common shares and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said. the new offer, the second sweetened deal redstone has proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said. last week, the management group submitted what it

adjust capacity to lower demand. industry commissioner karl-heinz narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by december 1988. he has proposed a return to the free market, which under ec law is supposed to exist except in times of \"manifest crisis.\" but diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on march 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. ministers from the ec's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures, they said. industry sources said the plan presented to narjes by the ec steelmakers' lobby group eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a \"voluntary\" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed. eurofer added the

tightening s/p trading directors of the chicago mercantile exchange will meet wednesday to consider a membership petition asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading activities in the widely-popular standard and poor's 500 stock index futures pit, an exchange executive said. the petition calls for elimination of dual trading, a legal practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade for their own account. but exchange officials noted this practice also provides an opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called \"front-running\", where traders enter orders for their own account before executing orders for their customers. leo melamed, cme special counsel, said directors will rule on the petition on wednesday, but added that a special s and p advisory committee has been studying s and p 500 futures trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to submit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days. in addition to a recommendation on dual trading, melamed said the special committee will also make suggestions about a possible automatic order entry and execution system for s and p 500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that would alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit. melamed said directors are likely to approve the recommendations of the special committee because \"most actions of the board are in line with committee recommendations.\" cme senior vice president gerald beyer said if the board accepts the member's petition this week, a rule change will be submitted to the commodity futures trading commission for approval. if the board does nothing, or rejects the petition request, a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership for a vote within 15 days, beyer said. melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on before the recommendations from the special committee are made \"it will confuse the issue.\" not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict dual trading. although jonathan wolff, senior vice president at donaldson lufkin and jenrette, noted dual trading is evident on most exchanges. \"it's a question of the integrity of the person you do business with,\" wolff said. futures traders who act as brokers, however, maintain that trading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up for errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in chaotic futures trading pits. \"to have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult for a broker to function because of his errors,\" said john michael, vice president at first options of chicago. \"what it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved,\" he said. furthermore, the competitive nature of futures brokerage makes front-running risky to a broker's livelihood, he said. \"if i ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running), or even suspected him of doing it, i would cut him off,\" michael said. an average broker in the treasury bond futures pit, for instance, will fill orders for 5,000 to 10,000 contracts a day at 1.25 dlrs per contract, floor sources said. even figuring what is considered a typical 25 pct loss for errors such brokerage can be lucrative. front-running by brokers not only runs the market risk of an adverse price move, but also the risk of losing the brokerage business, michael said. reuter ", "540": "benguet corp <be>

problem more than two mln tonnes of surplus maize dotted across zimbabwe in huge piles is posing an economic headache for the country. the grain, southern africa's staple, has been bought by the grain marketing board (gmb) at prices guaranteed before it was planted, and is costing the gmb about 27 mln dlrs a month in storage and interest payments to make the purchases. accumulated over the past two years of bumper harvests, the surplus represents about two years of domestic consumption and is set to grow as further deliveries are due shortly. some deals have been made with aid donors, such as european countries and australia, to provide zimbabwe with wheat in return for maize sent to neighbouring mozambique, where the united nations has urged greater world efforts to feed the hungry. but transport constraints keep those figures low and the only significant dent was a sale of 250,000 tonnes to south africa last year. because of the costs it has incurred, the gmb cannot afford to give the maize away and the standard 90 kg bags have been accumulating, economists here said. but failure to find buyers on glutted world grain markets is damaging zimbabwe, as it needs foreign exchange to finance imports for other areas of the economy, the economists added. \"at present, it is a no-win situation. let us hope some of the extra aid (un) secretary general javier perez de cuellar called for at the weekend will be spent here,\" a western aid specialist said. \"at least this year's poor rains haven't exacerbated the situation too badly,\" he added. rainfall during the current rainy season has been far below average, ravaging all but the irrigated lands of large commercial farmers. while this may curb the amount of maize delivered this year to the gmb, the government also acted late last year to slash maize production and force diversification. calling for a switch to other crops such as oilseeds, agriculture minister moven mahachi said an economically-viable price of 180 dlrs a tonne would be paid this year for only half the amount of maize bought by the gmb in 1986, and above that growers would be paid an unprofitable 100 dlrs. the poor rains have also adversely affected other crops, such as sorghum, soybeans, groundnuts, tobacco and cotton, the agriculture ministry reported at the end of february. reuter ", "634": "technology/chip industry seeks custom designs u.s. semiconductor manufacturers, struggling to stem a river of red ink, are increasingly looking toward customized designs rather than mass-market chips for future profits. the market for customized chips - semiconductors designed for a very specific application or product - is expected to expand by 25 to 30 pct this year, compared with only about six pct for the entire integrated circuit industry. market researcher dataquest inc estimates that sales of customized chips totaled about 4.5 billion dlrs worldwide last year, about 12 pct of the total chip market. by 1990, however, customized chips are expected to represent a 12 billion to 15 billion dlr market, about 25 pct of total chip sales. more important for their vendors, because they are not a standard design customized chips represent a sellers' market, and prices and profit margins can be set accordingly. high volume memory chips have become \"a perfect commodity market,\" robert brodersen, a professor of electrical engineering at the university of california at berkeley, told an industry forum. \"the product is interchangeable between one manufacturer and another and customers base their buying decisions almost entirely on price,\" brodersen said. he predicted that, in the next few years, only a handful of the world's largest chip manufacturers (most of them japanese) will produce memory chips, the standard electronic component found in everything from digital watches to computers. \"the rest of the industry just won't be involved.\" last week's international solid state circuits conference, the chip industry's annual forum for new developments, seemed to support brodersen's prediction. of the 116 papers presented at the conference, some 40 pct had japanese authors, the first time they have outnumberd the united states. most of the japanese chip designs were in the memory category, including nippon telephone and telegraph co's attention-grabbing 16 mln bit dynamic random access memory (dram) chip, 16 times more powerful than anything now available. the most advanced memory chip described by a u.s. company was international business machine corp's <ibm> four mln bit chip, and ibm only manufactures chips for its own internal use, not for the open market. the problem with memory chips is that they are all based on the same, well known design standards, so they are easy to copy and inexpensive to manufacture. because such large japanese conglomerates as sony corp <sne>, nec corp, <nipny> matushita and mitsui have their own enormous consumer and electronics product lines, they also have a guaranteeed internal market for their chips, so they can produce huge amounts at a very low cost per unit. customized chips, however, are designed for a specific customer, manufactured in small quantities and expensive relative to standard chips. computer markets are increasingly looking to customized chips because they are difficult to copy, thus making the final product harder to clone as well. intel corp <intc>, the leading manufacturer of the microprocessors that form the brains of most computers, alerted the industry to its intention to switch to customized chips last fall. the company, which just reported a loss for 1986, said it will spend 75 mln dlrs over the next three years to turn itself into a leading manufacturer of custom and semi-custom chips. intel joins some 275 companies already competing for a piece of the customized chip business but it has an advantage that the others do not. ibm, which owns a 20 pct stake in intel, has agreed to share the designs for many of the 15,000 chips it makes for its own use. intel will customize those designs and sell them to others. it will also get to use ibm's proprietary computer system for designing chips, considered by experts to be one of the most advanced in the world. intel's success is still not guaranteed, however. industry analysts noted that it is far different to design a mass market item than a customized chip that requires a close working relationship with the customer. intel spent five years and 100 mln dlrs developing its newest 30386 microprocessor. a much faster turnarouond time, and much lower development costs, will be required for customized chips if the firm is to succeed. reuter ", "635": "sears to restructure distribution ", "636":

provision required by the office of the comptroller of the currency, the sec said. continental had originally listed 565 mln dlrs of the loan loss provision as a credit loss and another 425 mln dlrs

distressed loans to the federal deposit insurance corp, the sec said. the bank should have listed 990 mln dlrs as a credit loss instead of 565 mln dlrs and should not have charecterized the other 425 mln dlrs as a provision for loss on sale of loans, the sec said. continental agreed to the settlement with the sec without admitting or denying any violations, the sec said. but it agreed to restate its 1984 financial statements to accommodate the sec's objections and to report to its shareholders a summarized version of the sec's administrative action against it, the agency said. a continental

regret this outcome, but the responsibility for it rests entirely with the local union bargaining committees,\" the company said in a statement. \"we will, therefore, initiate the actions necessary to place the new jeep product in an alternative location rather than at kenosha.\" uaw officials said during the weekend they did not regard the collapse of talks as final after the company's \"final\" proposal on a new contract was unanimously rejected by union bargainers. but amc said the union's rejection of its concessions package means that plants in kenosha and milwaukee will lose 6,500 jobs because the assembly complex in kenosha \"will not be getting new work\" as had been proposed with a new contract. \"this unfortunate outcome demonstrates the difficulty of maintaining existing

broker sees wider data access the major u.s. government bond brokers are likely to give in to pressure from regulators and investors within the next 18 months, making their direct-dealing screens

holdings corp, one of the largest of the four bond brokers that dominate the business. in a telephone interview, lacy said \"within 18 months, we think the number of players will be expanded.\" currently, the four major brokers will sell their direct-dealing screens to only primary dealers in u.s. government securities or those that have applied to the federal reserve bank of new york to become a primary dealer. the u.s. justice department is looking into whether limiting access to the screens to just a small group of dealers is a violation of u.s. anti-trust laws. primary dealers, of which there are now 40, are an elite group of firms approved to buy treasury securities directly from the fed. but lacy said that any agreement to expand access to the brokers' direct-dealing screens is likely to be not as far-reaching as some would like. instead of making screens available to any firm willing to pay for one, he said, it is more likely that a \"second tier\" will be established. he also said that rmj is not willing to break away from the group of bond brokers and be the only firm to make its screens widely available to any one who wants them. bond market sources had speculated that rmj is better prepared to offer its services nationwide than its three major competitors. lacy also said that he does not see any immediate pressure for a further cut in commissions paid on bond transactions any time soon. in late 1985, transaction fees paid to brokers were cut in half to 39 dlrs per mln dlr transaction from 78 dlrs. some u.s. primary bond dealers have been

exchange spokeswoman. \"this will change the way oil is transacted in the real world,\" said said thomas mckiernan, mckiernan and co chairman. foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against nymex prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to nymex prices, mckiernan explained. the expanded program \"will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when nymex does,\" said frank capozza, secretary of century resources inc. the rule change, which has already taken effect for platinum futures on nymex, is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in u.s. energy futures, according to traders and analysts. currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called an exchange for physical or efp, must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction. under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an efp and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day, according to exchange officials. when nymex announced its proposed rule change in december, nymex president rosemary mcfadden, said, \"expansion of the efp provision

point/viacom international <via> a bidding war for viacom international inc, one of the largest u.s. entertainment companies, pitted a management group and other investors against national amusements inc, a closely held theater operator. both sides raised their bids over the weekend. a source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side. he said if outside directors approve the management proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week. \"it would take 20 days from the day we mail,\" said the source. the source predicted national amusements, controlled by investor sumner redstone, would need \"half a year\" to complete a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must accompany any change in control of viacom's broadcast licenses and cable television franchises. redstone was not available for comment. some of wall street's arbitrage players said it was a rare situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. one said redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to the viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win. the independent directors of viacom were called into a meeting today. word on a decision was expected early tomorrow. viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. one major wall street firm issued a sell recommendation. \"we think we're at the end now, in terms of bidding,\" said the firm's arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified. both redstone's proposal and the management proposal would create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. the management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5 billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock. redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash, a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock stock of arsenal holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity interest in the restructured viacom. one arbitrageur calculated the equity in the redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the total package worth 52 dlrs per share. management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred. the arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs. redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond april 30 that a merger with arsenal is not consummated. the plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during may and 12 pct thereafter. previously redstone offered eight pct interest. other arbitrageurs said both redstone and the management group, led by president and chief executive terrence elkes, were offering high prices. \"redstone really wants to own the company,\" one said. another said management seemed to have the edge on the timing issue. redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov viacom's 35 mln shares. a wall street analyst said it was hard to determine what the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. he noted as an example that new stock in fmc corp <fmc>, which adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now just over 30 dlrs. last week, viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two two cts per share from 23 cts. the

domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world. the council said that in the talks, canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of u.s. duties against allegedly subsidized exports. a recent example was the 15 per cent duty the u.s. imposed on canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized. the council said the chief u.s. concerns included ending curbs against u.s. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and the so-called \"cultural

supply reductions by the u.s. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the two organizations said while the australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments. australia's proposals, which aim to reduce u.s. target prices and \"quarantine\" u.s. wheat stocks, would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on u.s. farmers, they said. other countries, including australia, have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past u.s. acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said. \"we will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers,\" jim miller, president of nawg said. \"we sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture,\" miller said. reuter ", "742": "gelco <gel> sees flat 1987 pretax operating net gelco corp said that, excluding the effects of a restructuring plan, it expects pre-tax operating earnings for the year to end

international inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the company. pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr takeover bid for american medical with several large shareholders, including the biggest investor, the bass family of texas. however, the bass family has not indicated support one way or the other for his offer, he said. pesch, in an interview with reuters, said based on the conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage whether he had majority support. he said, however, there is support for his offer. pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held discussions other than the bass family and the wedge group inc, the only other holder of more than five pct of american medical stock. earlier today, wedge group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, said it held discussions with pesch, american medical management and other american medical shareholders. wedge, in a filing with the securities and exchange commission, said it believes a restructuring of american medical and its business would be \"highly desirable and appropriate at this time.\" \"that's the sort of position that i find a large segment of shareholders of ami really share,\" said pesch. pesch said he held discussions with wedge about joining his takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each american medical share. wedge said it has no plans to join in an effort to seek control of american medical, but it would not rule out a future takeover try. pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal with the bass family. some analysts saw the wedge statement as a boost to pesch's takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some shareholder dissatisfaction following american medical's previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from pesch. american medical is expected to resist pesch's latest bid. larry feinberg, an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc said a management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out. an american medical spokesman said the company will comment on the new pesch offer by march 10. analysts continue to view the bass family as a factor in the outcome of the bid for control of american medical. the bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in american medical, and the company has previously said the investors support management's internal plan to improve the company's performance. the bass family would not comment on american medical or pesch. pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of republic health corp last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on wall street because of the long time it took to finish the republic acquisition. republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall street questioning whether financing can be completed for the much larger american medical takeover proposal. pesch's first offer for american medical was made without an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to wall street. however, pesch entered his second offer with representation from donaldson, lufkin, and jenrette securities and security pacific merchant banking group. \"i don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly environment,\" pesch said. pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing arrangements are being made. he did say if he succeeds in acquiring american medical he plans to keep much of american medical management in place. he said he plans to combine the company with republic to form an efficient network of hospitals. analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could be made for american medical. byron nimocks of e.f. hutton group said improved second fiscal quarter earnings could make american medical stock worth about 20 dlrs per share. nimocks estimates american medical earnings for the second quarter ended february 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct loss last year. nimocks said pesch's revised offer is not worth much more than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously. but feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction could be completed because of the revised structure of the offer. \"i think it's much more doable,\" he said. analysts have said american medical has begun a turnaround by replacing some members of management and reducing costs. reuter ", "748": "three convicted in home state failure marvin warner and two fellow officers of the former home state savings bank were

(renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the united states but also to the newly industrialised countries.\" this could result in further major losses of market share, particularly in the non-oecd area, which accounts for almost a quarter of french exports, it said. until the competitive ability of industry improved, the authorities would have \"little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly,\" it added. but rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next, the oecd said. written mainly in december last year, the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct surge in january consumer prices, caused partly by the government's deregulation of service sector tariffs. \"we took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost,\" one oecd official commented. oecd officials said the january data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct. the government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct. but the oecd backed the government's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year, with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation. with french unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the oecd area, the inflation differential between france and its main trading rival, west germany, could fall to just one pct this year, it said. on the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits. \"for the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,\" it said. reuter ", "843": "painewebber<pwj> unit ups shaer shoe <shs> stake mitchell hutchins asset management inc, a new york investment firm and subsidiary

"regan departure makes 3rd volcker term likely last week's white house shake-up has increased the odds that federal reserve board chairman paul volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to the fed say. but they said that no decision on the appointment, which must be filled this august, has been taken by the white house and volcker too has not made up his mind. former white house chief of staff donald regan, who resigned last week when ex-senator howard baker was named as his replacement, was implacably opposed to volcker and tried often to undermine him. it is an open secret in washington that regan tried to ensure that volcker, first appointed in 1979 by president carter, will not be offered a third term by president reagan. only volcker's key allies in the reagan administration, vice-president george bush and treasury secretary james baker, kept regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said. sources close to the administration say regan leaked a story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that beryl sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers, had been chosen to replace volcker. but as the administration's credibility was increasingly under fire, it became clear that regan's power to bring about such changes was on the wane. the sources said new white house chief of staff howard baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the treasury department and is likely to respect his views on the fed chairmanship. as a moderate republican, baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to volcker. \"this new white house is going to need all the strength it can get,\" said one source when asked about the possibility of volcker's reappointment. paul volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the united states and around the world. at a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question, volcker's departure would definitely undermine u.s. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say. u.s. officials say volcker works very closely with treasury secretary baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation. the two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry, but recent statements by volcker, in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation, signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the treasury position. and a recent statement by a reagan administration official that the two men saw \"exactly eye-to-eye\" on the dollar was seen as an indication of baker's support for the fed chairman. baker is understood to have played a key role in volcker's reappointment to the fed in mid-1983. the sources said baker respects volcker and when appointed treasury secretary in february 1985, he decided to ensure a good working relationship, in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely. regan, treasury secretary during president reagan's first term, was formerly head of wall street's largest brokerage firm merrill lynch and came to washington determined to be america's pre-eminent economic spokesman. he developed a deep antipathy for volcker, whose political skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took much more seriously. but the sources said volcker would have to be invited to stay. \"is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay otherwise,\" said one. \"he'd have to be asked,\" said stephen axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the fed and now vice-chairman of nikko securities co. international. otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not awe-inspiring. and if volcker left this augsut, he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced fed boards in years. many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability. an experienced successor, therefore, would seem a necessity. one widely mentioned possibility is secretary of state george shultz, whose experience as treasury secretary under preesident nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal. but shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-iran scandal, while vice-chairman manuel johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job. other potential candidates include economist alan greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic adviser, new york fed president e. gerald corrigan, federal deposit insurance corp chairman william seidman, and sprinkel. long a regan protege, sprinkel's chances may be damaged by his patron's departure from the white house. reuter ", "854": "cbt february volume down 14 pct from year ago february

early today to prevent a deal on cutting overflowing milk production from turning sour before trying to agree widescale reforms in other surplus sectors. meanwhile, protests from angry european farmers over successive attempts to scale down unwanted community food production appeared to be gathering strength. in the northeastern spanish city of saragossa thousands of spanish farmers battled with police during a march to demand a better deal from brussels. the farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets and occupied local government buildings while in the southern city of malaga, citrus growers dumped more 20 tonnes of lemons on the streets in protest at ec duties. towards the end of last week, about 10,000 angry west german farmers marched through the streets of hanover burning effigies of agriculture minister ignaz kiechle while in france pig-farmers barricaded roads in protest at falling prices. europe's 12 mln farmers are furious over plans by the european commission to cut subsidised prices and severely limit farmers' automatic right to sell unwanted food into public stores at high guaranteed ec prices. in the toughest-ever proposals for the annual price review, at which ec ministers set the levels of subsidies, agriculture commissioner frans andriessen has included measures that could result in price cuts for some products of up to 11 pct. the plans form part of an on-going campaign to reform surplus-creating farm policies that have become a political embarrassment at home and commercial flash-point abroad and threatened to leave the community with no cash for other areas. andriessen's latest package comes only months after a decision to cut dairy production by 9.5 pct over two years and to slash beef prices by around 10 pct. that decision, agreed in outline last december after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations, was hailed as the most significant step yet in the reform offensive, but has since run into difficulties over the fine print. west germany and ireland are objecting to the new rules governing the sales of surplus butter into cold stores, but the commission is loathe to abandon its position as the accord has been used as the inspiration for andriessen's latest package. ministers failed yesterday to overcome the problem, and resumed negotiations in a bid to finalise the details before starting the price review which is confidently predicted to last many months. ec farm spending currently swallows two thirds of an overall annual budget of around 40 billion dlrs and is almost entirely blamed for

following a damaging drought in brazil. with no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted. lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring, coffee dealers said. the u.s. and brazil, the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks. jon rosenbaum, u.s. assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council adjourned, \"a majority of producers, led by brazil, were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria. \"we want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their political influence in the ico.\" brazilian coffee institute (ibc) president jorio dauster countered, \"negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas, not negotiate them.\" previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts exported, which gave brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. a majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme. but most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks, which would reduce brazil's share to 28.8 pct. consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it. a last-minute attempt by colombia, the second largest exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together. delegates speculated brazil's financial problems, illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings. developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings, particularly some african nations and colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ico's failure to agree quotas, analysts said. the expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates forecast. the ico executive board will meet march 31, but the full council is not due to meet again until september, delegates said. reuter ", "875": "ec ministers postpone talks on saving dairy pact european community (ec) farm ministers early today abandoned talks aimed at saving an

access to the worst-hit towns of edgecumbe, whakatane and the forestry town of kawerau severely restricted. yesterday's quake measured 6.25 on the richter scale. the seismologist said if the pattern of other large earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to several weeks, declining in frequency and magnitude. but the chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out. civil

fear that we will become a country with high unemployment,\" said takashi kiuchi, senior economist for the long-term credit bank of japan ltd. the government, which published the january unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions. \"at present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving,\" a labour ministry official said. finance minister kiichi miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in april. prime minister yasuhiro nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. the yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said. although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said koichi tsukihara, deputy general manager of sumitomo bank ltd's economics department. however, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years. the economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports. although japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned. \"the three pct figure could translate into a relatively high figure if european methods

chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last saturday the government could not fix the taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one u.s. dollar due to u.s. pressure for an appreciation of the local currency. the federation asked the government on february 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level. the federation said in its request that many local textile exporters were operating without profit and would go out of business if the rate continued to fall. it said the taiwan dollar has risen almost 14 pct against the u.s. dollar since september 1985 while the south korean won climbed only four pct. the singapore and hong kong dollars remained stable against the u.s. unit in that period, it said. many local bankers and economists predict taiwan's dollar will rise to between

economists told reuters. they said with real growth at an estimated 1.9 pct in calendar 1986, indicating signs of recovery from the 1.7 pct shrinkage in 1985, the government was likely to hold its course and wait for measures introduced in last year's budget to work. last march hu cut corporation tax to 33 pct from 40 pct, and income tax was reduced by the same margin. last year the government also reduced wage costs by introducing a wage freeze and cutting employer contributions to the mandatory state savings scheme, the central provident fund (cpf), to 15 pct of salaries from 25 pct. \"i don't foresee any new or additional stimulus because the economy is now improving,\" said clemente escano, vice president of the union bank of switzerland. the government's economic report for calendar 1986, issued last week, said the cpf reduction and other cost-cutting measures only started to bite in the third quarter of 1986. but the report said over half the economy -- especially the commerce, financial, and business services sectors -- continued to be depressed by weakness in the surrounding regional economies and an excess of domestic property. the sources said the fragility of the economic recovery suggested the government would not introduce much of its planned consumption tax in the coming financial year. in last year's budget hu said he planned to set up collecting machinery for the tax. economists said a campaign against smoking this year might be the opportunity for him to levy the tax on tobacco as a first step towards its wider use. the sources said the government does not look likely to raise more revenue in this year's budget. last year's budget projected a 3.22 billion dlr budget deficit for fiscal 1986/87, but the economic report projected an overall calendar 1986 surplus of three billion. lower tax revenue was balanced by rising investment income and stringent controls on government operating expenditure, helped by the wage-freeze policy. anthony k.p. lee, vice-president and deputy general manager of american express bank ltd, said he expected nothing exciting from this year's budget. lee said, \"it will probably be a non-event as most of the tax benefits were given last year. the economy has already started moving so it does not need government support.\" last week's economic report attributed the one pct decline in domestic demand last year mainly to a sharp decline in private construction, so this sector hopes for some relief from the budget, economists said. the economic report said the sector's activity declined by 25.3 pct in calendar 1986 after a 13.9 pct contraction in 1985. a further decline is expected in 1987. but in last year's budget a 30 pct rebate on tax for industrial and commercial properties was raised to 50 pct until the end of 1988, so the most hu is likely to do is add incentives for creating property investment unit trusts. the only measures known to be in tomorrow's budget are incentives to encourage population growth, including incentives to families who have three children. deputy prime minister goh chok tong has already announced the government will try to encourage three-child families,

should provide currency and interest rate futures, and incorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stock index futures contracts. the proposal said transactions in all these contracts must be conducted on the same market so participants can readily engage in arbitrage between various financial instruments. to make this possible, the proposal calls for new legislation which would administer all related futures and options transactions under the same legal framework. banking sources said they expect that initially the currency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures would include japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit, three-month eurodollar deposits and 20-year u.s. treasury bonds. banking sources quoted federation chairman yoshiro araki as saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible because it would help promote the liberalisation of japan's financial markets. araki said he had no intention of limiting prospective market

the u.s. request since the u.s. federal reserve bank of new york approved five new primary government securities dealers, including two japanese brokerages, last december. they said the ministry will have to approve the u.s. request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as open to foreigners as those of the u.s. analysts said japan has proceeded rapidly with financial deregulation since 1984, but has not touched upon the clear division between the securities and banking businesses. japanese banks and securities houses have fought hard to protect their interests, but analysts said the banks are finding it increasingly difficult to earn money in traditional fields. officials of major japanese banks said they will pay special attention to the ministry's reaction to u.s. bank requests

with u.s. china called on the united states to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. but the u.s. embassy replied that chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the u.s. out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said peking itself would have to persuade congress to change laws which limit its exports. the official international business newspaper today published china's demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of u.s. secretary of state george shultz. \"it is extremely important that the u.s. market reduce its restrictions on chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand chinese exports,\" the editorial said. \"the u.s. should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for chinese goods and admit china into the generalised system of preference (gsp). \"despite easing of curbs on u.s. technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries,\" it added the paper also printed an article by china's commercial counsellor in its washington embassy, chen shibiao, who said that \"all kinds of difficulties and restrictions\" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. he named them as u.s. protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. the paper also printed a table showing that, since bilateral trade began in 1972, china has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. it shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs. a u.s. embassy official said the u.s. did not accept peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude goods shipped to hong kong and then trans-shipped to u.s. while u.s. figures are based on country of origin. he said that, if china wants to obtain gsp status, it will have to lobby congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent peking getting such status. the u.s. trade act of 1974 says that to qualify for gsp, china must be a member of the general agreement of tariffs and trade (gatt), for which it applied in july 1986, and \"not be dominated or controlled by international communism.\" the official said china was well aware of the laws, some of which date to the anti-communist early 1950's, but that there is not sufficient political will in the u.s. to change them. china has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the u.s. within the last two years, which the u.s. side won, he said. but, for the first time, china signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may lead the u.s. side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added. another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in peking's application to gatt. \"china has the potential to disrupt world markets, especially in textiles. other gatt countries will be nervous about china in this respect. but there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in gatt,\" the diplomat said. poland, czechoslovakia, hungary and romania are members of gatt but none has china's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports. in a speech today in the northeast city of dalian, u.s. secretary of state george shultz said his country welcomed china's interest in participating in gatt. \"the process of chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the gatt rules were not designed for a large economy of the chinese type,\" shultz said. \"china can play an important role by actively joining gatt discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. china can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its gatt participation,\" he said. the problems facing u.s.-china trade and gatt membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially for exports, and a de facto dual currency system. in a memorandum backing its application presented to gatt last month, china said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with \"guidance planning\" and economic levers. the diplomat said that, to join gatt, china had much to do. reuter ", "925": "no bundesbank policy changes expected thursday the bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on thursday, as exchange rates

tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system. the tender was announced last friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon. because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. dealers said the bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down. but because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings, the bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender. \"i would not be surprised if the bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,\" one dealer said. \"they would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is

country's debt problems, senior west german banking sources said. the sources, speaking ahead of a meeting later today between brazilian finance minister dilson funaro and his west german counterpart gerhard stoltenberg, also believed brazil should come up with a convincing economic recovery program. their comments echoed those of british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson, who met funaro yesterday. funaro is currently on a european trip seeking to involve governments in negotiations with commercial banks on rescheduling part of brazil's foreign debt, which totals some 109 billion dlrs. but lawson told funaro brazil had to solve its problems with the banks rather than governments. diplomatic sources in bonn said funaro would leave early tomorrow morning for zurich after meeting stoltenberg this evening. funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with the imf and said there is no question of brazil agreeing to an austerity program with the fund. however, the west german banking sources said institutions here felt it was particularly important that brazil presented a credible recovery program and that there be a \"rapprochement\" with the imf. \"consultations are the least that can be expected,\" said one banker. funaro's trip follows the decision by brazil 10 days ago to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. it has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs. one senior banker closely involved in brazilian debt negotiation offered qualified support for a call from funaro for a change in the structure of the advisory committee of banks which has coordinated brazilian debt since 1982. funaro said yesterday that u.s. banks, holding 35 pct of brazilian debt, were over-represented on the 14-bank advisory committee with 50 pct of the committee seats. he said brazil might adopt a different approach to its creditor banks, involving separate discussions with the regions. such a move would be in brazil's interest, since european banks have been more supportive than u.s. banks of alternative debt solutions, such as interest capitalisation. the senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regional approach, saying: \"there must be one committee and one solution.\" but he added: \"there must be an understanding that special requests from special regions be taken into account.\" german banks had objected to the fact that the idea of interest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. it was imperative that alternative options be considered. \"the menu must become richer,\" the banker said. banking sources said commercial banks would not be involved in today's talks with funaro. a spokesman for the bundesbank in frankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented. west german banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to the brazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions in the united states, because of their lower exposure. according to bundesbank data from september last year, west german bank exposure to latin america of slightly under 16 billion marks represented less than five pct of all foreign credit.

volcker term likely last week's white house shake-up has increased the odds that federal reserve board chairman paul volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to the fed say. but they said that no decision on the appointment, which must be filled this august, has been taken by the white house and volcker too has not made up his mind. former white house chief of staff donald regan, who resigned last week when ex-senator howard baker was named as his replacement, was implacably opposed to volcker and tried often to undermine him. it is an open secret in washington that regan tried to ensure that volcker, first appointed in 1979 by president carter, will not be offered a third term by president reagan. only volcker's key allies in the reagan administration, vice-president george bush and treasury secretary james baker, kept regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said. sources close to the administration say regan leaked a story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that beryl sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers, had been chosen to replace volcker. but as the administration's credibility was increasingly under fire, it became clear that regan's power to bring about such changes was on the wane. the sources said new white house chief of staff howard baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the treasury department and is likely to respect his views on the fed chairmanship. as a moderate republican, baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to volcker. \"this new white house is going to need all the strength it can get,\" said one source when asked about the possibility of volcker's reappointment. paul volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the united states and around the world. at a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question, volcker's departure would definitely undermine u.s. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say. u.s. officials say volcker works very closely with treasury secretary baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation. the two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry, but recent statements by volcker, in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation, signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the treasury position. and a recent statement by a reagan administration official that the two men saw \"exactly eye-to-eye\" on the dollar was seen as an indication of baker's support for the fed chairman. baker is understood to have played a key role in volcker's reappointment to the fed in mid-1983. the sources said baker respects volcker and when appointed treasury secretary in february 1985, he decided to ensure a good working relationship, in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely. regan, treasury secretary during president reagan's first term, was formerly head of wall street's largest brokerage firm merrill lynch and came to washington determined to be america's pre-eminent economic spokesman. he developed a deep antipathy for volcker, whose political skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took much

mentioned possibility is secretary of state george shultz, whose experience as treasury secretary under preesident nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal. but shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-iran scandal, while vice-chairman manuel johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job. other potential candidates include economist alan greenspan,

raises for salaried employees and is reducing the size of the merit raise pool to 3.5 pct of the total amount available for salaries from 5.5 pct last year, a company spokesman said. he said gm will no longer include merit raises in the calculation of base pay but will make them simply lump-sum payments. as a result, the merit raises will not be included in the calculation of pensions and other benefits. the change affects about 109,000 salaried workers in the u.s. and canada. gm last year eliminated cost of living increases for salaried workers, making pay increases based on merit alone. as

from last year, reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in trinidad and tobago. other income rose to 251 mln dlrs

a strategy to defend prices. an ico special meeting ended last night in london with exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after prices soared following a prolonged drought in brazil. arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly plummet. however, he said the

because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs, wall street analysts said. previously, it was expected the business would peak and decline at some point in the next five years. the improved outlook results from amr corp's <amr> decision to order 40 new planes powered by cf6-80c2 ge engines. \"creative financial footwork helped ge get the order,\" said nicholas heymann, analyst at drexel burnham lambert inc. amr declined to go into detail on financing arrangements for its order of 15 boeing co <ba> and 25 <airbus industrie> twinjet long distance aircraft. but amr said it was using \"rent-a-plane leases\" that allow it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt structure. amr also has the right to decline delivery of the planes or return them on short notice. the arrangement protects amr in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe downturn in the economy. from ge's point of view the package looks like a good deal for several reasons, heymann said. ge will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of delivery, heymann noted. and if for some reason amr decides not to take the planes ge's financial arm, general electric financial services inc, would have little trouble rounding up another airline that wanted the fuel efficient planes. on the whole, the deal appears to pose little risk for ge, heymann said. ge's stock declined

operating profits from ge's jet engine business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs by 1991. revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last year, with well over half of the business in the military sector, according to analysts' estimates. the rosy outlook for ge's jet engine business coincides with an upbeat performance in other segments. heymann expects ge to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first quarter of 1987. saying many will be suprised by the results, he believes ge has shown through its acquisition of rca corp that it has a \"unique ability\" to buy a major business and reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other elements of its 14 business areas. smith sees ge earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current quarter. he credits good

on underwriters the bank of england proposed that banks in britain for the first time will have to seek authorization to be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets. in addition, the bank has proposed limits on the amount of credit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they lead manage. the proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative paper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and deposit takers and may be modified, the bank said. the rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond securities issued each year. in 1986, about 183 billion dlrs of new eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled by euromoney magazine. up until now, there have been no restrictions on lead managing eurobond issues. however, eurobond market participants believe the bank of england is concerned about intense competition for market share which may have caused some firms to expose themselves to imprudent credit risk. competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as banks compete to offer the best terms. but the new rules suggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as regulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk than it can handle. banking sources said that while the bank of england is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing to accept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters act prudently. \"the bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank's lead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill and experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market concerned...,\" the bank's proposal said. once a firm has received permission to act as lead underwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of the face amount of the securities. nominal exposure exceeding 60 pct of capital must be reported to the bank of england and it must be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct of capital. the exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of 28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. after that, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be assessed at their full face value. the rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities, revolving credits or commercial paper, the bank said. the bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen its supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which called for comments from professionals by march 31 to allow their possible inclusion in the banking bill in time for its planned final discussion in parliament, scheduled before summer. the new banking bill, updating the 1979 banking act, is the third leg of the conservative government's legislation for the supervision of financial institutions. it is to feature alongside the financial services act, aimed to bolster investor protection, and the building societies act, which put these institutions on an equal footing with banks. the proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between recognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legal controls, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors. proposals to require banks to inform the bank of england in advance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of their capital, and to have the bank supervise exposures between 10 and 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed. however, preliminary consultations with bank representatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be flawed, it said. most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a case-by-case basis rather than along general lines. amendments involved the bank's proposed treatment of exposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other units of their own group of companies, the paper showed. they also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to local governments and other public sector entities, and of exposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks. proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as collateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed. exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their own group of companies would usually be looked into on a case-by-case basis under new proposals, it said. the paper said exposures to state-owned industries and other public sector authorities in the u.k. and abroad should be given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments provided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees. it cautioned that exposures to u.k. local authorities and those guaranteed by the british export credit guarantee department would probably not qualify for such treatment. on credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of another bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceiling could be exceeded in individual cases. but the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking to take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and state in writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary's balance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said. on collateral security, it said this \"should normally only be taken into account when considering the acceptability of a bank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base.\" \"the presence of security taken on its own will be considered by the bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure in excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptional circumstances and even then to a very limited extent,\" it said. reuter ", "1275": "american aircraft buys into helicopter builder <american aircraft corp>

enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said. prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the soviet union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said. but the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the soviet union said. \"from a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year),\" gail martell, chief meteorologist for e.f. hutton said. the next six weeks in the ussr's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, martell and other analysts said. \"where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us,\" an agriculture department authority on the ussr said. the soviet union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. this would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the usda analyst said. with a timely spring, soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower. normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. this winter, however, snowcover in soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination. \"fall dryness may be a problem. there's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness,\" martell said. precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said. recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, jim candor, senior forecaster for accu weather, said. livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said. the dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding, they said. \"the soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don't have to buy (grains) now,\" a usda official said. but if the soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said. bad weather during the next six weeks could push the soviets back into the market, weather analysts said. \"a lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half,\" martell said. reuter ", "1299": "alcan (al)

sanford margoshes, oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc. \"but opec is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,\" he added. oil industry analysts said saudi arabia has led the attempt to get other opec members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december. the analysts said that to get others to hold the line, saudi arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the gulf cooperation council last weekend and at the cooperation council oil ministers' meeting the previous week. the saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said. \"they are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that saudi arabia or some other opec member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales,\" margoshes said. he added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales. analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. but it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts. analysts said that saudi arabia, with assistance from opec president rilwanu lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency opec meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the december pact is falling apart. daniel mckinley, oil analyst with smith barney, upham harris and co said, \"both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally.\" he believes an iranian trade mission to tokyo, which refused discounts to japanese buyers, brought japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions. oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of may dubai, which sent prices up on mideast sours, with dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the north sea crude oil market. traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of brent for japan and european trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments. north sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr. opec members' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions. indonesian oil minister subroto said today that opec production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on opec production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level. \"the production probably is about their quota level and largely because saudi arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result,\" margoshes said. analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. some believe prices can continue to rise if saudi arabia and opec hold steady in a refusal to discount. but others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short. marion stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the u.s. and oecd would keep demand for oil slack

negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ico delegates and traders said. the failure last night of international coffee organization, ico, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the london may price reaching a 4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close. the new york may price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb. pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ico talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said. the ico 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for march 2. this compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in february last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the brazilian crop. in a reuter interview, brazilian coffee institute, ibc, president jorio dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. \"if we have failed at the ico, at least we have tried,\" dauster said, adding \"now it is time to go and sell coffee.\" but brazil is keeping its marketing options open. it plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, dauster said. it is too difficult to forecast now. trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on london's futures market last year. a basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market \"in one go\" but is sold over a minimum of six months. the breakdown of the ico negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. consumers said \"objective criteria\" like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, dauster said. all elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ico. dauster said stocks and exports to ico members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings. it is a \"simplistic misconception that brazil can dictate\" policy to other producers. while consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve different share-outs of quota, dauster said. other delegates said there was more open talking at the ico and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise. consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them. \"we want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said. some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ico session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed. the ico executive board meets here march 30 to april 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. the board is due to meet in indonesia in june with a full council scheduled for september. more cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy latin american producer countries could bring ico members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. in that case quotas could come into force during the summer. but most delegates and traders said quotas before october are unlikely, while brazil's dauster noted the ico has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980. a clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. at least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability. in contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found. \"producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now,\" one consumer said. reuter ", "1312": "seaman furniture <seam> in stock split seaman

agencies held a meeting yesterday to discuss the situation. in a related development, small regional banks that have made loans to brazil and other heavily-indebted latin american countries, will meet with federal reserve chairman paul volcker here tomorrow. brazil, with about 108 billion dlrs in debt, shocked banks late last month when it stopped interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to them until it can work out its problems. brazil's trade surplus, its main source of foreign exchange has dwindled in recent months, making it difficult to service its debt. the official said the interagency meeting was called to discuss \"the general debt situation and compare notes on (brazilian finance minister dilson) funaro.\" funaro, who told reporters here that he wanted a political discussion with industrialized nations on brazil's debt problems in an effort to obtain more and faster lending from official sources, held discussions here on friday with volcker, treasury secretary james baker and other officials. another senior administration official said he was perplexed by funaro's decision to discuss the latest crisis with governments and not with creditor banks, at a time when brazil is in danger of losing short-term credit lines. \"we are not clear at all on his tactics. to me it seems bizarre, just bizarre,\" the official said. one official today described funaro's argument as \"nonsense,\" and said there had been a considerable flow of funds to brazil, for which that country was in arrears. funaro has said brazil acted to protect its reserves but wanted to avoid a confrontation. the consensus among administration officials seems to be that brazil's latest debt crisis is the result of the domestic economic problems. \"brazil is a special case, but there's no doubt they would not be in the mess they're in if they had not screwed-up their economic policy,\" a senior official added. several of the regional banks that will meet with volcker tomorrow declined to comment because the talks will be held at the fed's suggestion. \"since they are the hosts, we feel it's up to them if they want to say something,\" one regional bank official said. but other banking sources said that regional banks, many of which are refusing to continue lending to latin america, are dissatisfied with decisions of major banks such as citibank, in the

about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs, respectively, usda said. the department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments. deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year -- september-january. national weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel

crop, the u.s. agriculture department said. in its report on export markets for u.s. grains, the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the awb to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne. for example the recent large sales of wheat to china (1.5 mln tonnes) and egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the breakeven export price, it said. australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the guaranteed minimum price, gmp, calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the department said. in addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and storage are deducted from the gmp the farmer receives. but the department said the australian bureau of agricultural economics, bae, predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in 1989/90. the decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit u.s. wheat exports, the department said. reuter ", "1377": "lawson products inc

analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets. professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. that gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low. farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees. with the price outlook for both commodities so dismal, traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances. an announcement late friday that the usda will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop, means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized, traders said. here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the more attractive deal from the government, they added. cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the south to

had been hinting at a buyback program in meetings with institutional investors. he said the plan, which could cost more than five billion dlrs over four years, was similar in size to ford motor co's <f> repurchase program but smaller on a percentage basis than that of chrysler corp <c>. healy said general motors will have to borrow money to buy back stock on a large scale. the general motors plan, announced after a board of directors meeting in new york, calls for repurchase of up to 20 pct of the common stock by the end of 1990. the gm board also authorized repurchase of up to five mln class e <gme> and class h <gmh> shares. gm shares closed at 75-5/8, up 7/8, in composite trading prior to the company's announcement. however subsequently jefferies and co, which trades nyse-listed issues outside regular hours, said it was making a market in the shares at 77-1/2 to 78. \"the stock is obviously going to be strong tomorrow,\" said ronald glantz, analyst at montgomery securities. \"i don't know where the money (for the buyback) is coming from unless they borrow,\" glantz said. \"their credit rating is going to fall.\" gm said it anticipates a decrease in automotive capital spending. glantz believes gm could be inviting a strike this fall by going ahead with the buyback program at a time when it has 37,000 employees on indefinite layoff and 11 plants marked for closing. after deciding against a profit sharing bonus for workers and buying out perot for 743 mln dlrs \"this will be seen as rubbing salt into the wound,\" glantz said. \"gm must be challenging the union to make it the strike target.\" glantz said he is not changing his buy recommendation on gm and expects the shares to rise. but he said he did not think the overall plan was \"prudent.\" \"obviously we're going to get at least an opening gap in the stock tomorrow,\" hutton's phillippi said. he says gm apparently believes as a result of a cost reduction program plus the falloff in capital spending levels \"they can handle a stock buyback of this magnitude within the confines of their cash flow.\" phillippi, who has been telling clients to hold gm shares mainly for income, said on balance \"we've got to feel they're doing something constructive.\" reuter ", "1408": "nippon steel invests 8 mln dlrs in gtx corp gtx corp said nippon steel co of japan, in a move to diversify into high

blueprint for u.s. policy in the region that was meant to offset reagan's military aid program for nicaraguan rebels. the commission, headed by former secretary of state henry kissinger, had proposed a 8.4 billion dlr program through 1989. \"the soviet union and its allies have provided the sandinista regime military hardware and sufficient economic aid to keep nicaragua's failed economy afloat,\" reagan said. assistant secretary of state elliott abrams, who briefed reporters, said the administration will not try to link approval of military aid for the rebels, known as contras, with the vastly

developed the first standard form contract for use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap transactions, said thomas jasper, the association's co-chairman. the contract, unveiled at a press

said. privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all new issues eventually become part of either an interest rate or currency swap. an interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usually acting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other's interest payments on debt securities. usually, the issuer of a floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice versa. but the obligation for repayment of the debt remains with the original borrower. bank regulators have become concerned about the use of swaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient capital to cushion it. kenneth mccormick, a co-chairman of the isda and president of kleinwort benson cross financing inc, said the bank of england and the u.s. federal reserve board were expected later today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital standards for counterparties in swaps. the standards are part of the recently announced convergence agreement between the two countries in which regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements for institutions. mccormick told reporters the isda was concerned that a \"level playing field\" be maintained in the swaps market. he said if u.k. and u.s. banks were required to hold more primary capital against swap transactions than is the current practice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to issuers. the issuers might then choose to do business with lower-cost banks which are not subject to u.s. or u.k. banking rules. he said the isda had been working on a code of conduct for swap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort. that code should be completed

government's development aid fund (fad) would provide a special 25 billion peseta grant. the plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last

utility said it advised a customer task force this is one restructuring alternative being considered for the company's electric business. the structure is being evaluated as part of the company's overall initiative in response to several goals announced by new mexico governor garrey carruthers, it explained. public service new mexico said a central feature of its reorganization concept would be to separate the company's electric utility operation into independent generation and distribution entities, creating the opportunity for a targeted 35 mln dlr a year rate decrease. noting the use of the limited partnership structure by a variety of businesses recently, the company said it believes \"the concept may well have an application in the utility business and intend to investigate it fully.\" the generation company would provide projected power needs of the distribution entity under a 30-year \"power security agreement\" which would have a federally regulated rate structure, the company said. public service new mexico said the restructuring could provide for its gas and water utilities and its non-utility companies becoming subsidaries of the proposed holding company approved by the company's shareholders in may 1986. this holding company would be the general partner of the limited partnership, the company said. the company said its limited partnership concept was presented to an ad hoc customer task force convened by gov. carruthers to review the company's reorganization proposals. it said the reorganization and limited partnership are an alternative structure that would help reduce rates through a lower overall cost of capital. last month the governor said \"i have outlined to pnm critical goals which i have asked them to cooperate with may administration in achieving\" adding the goals include immediate rate reduction, stabilization of future rates and stimulation of business expansion. the company told the task force the new distribution company, under the limited partnership alternative or otherwise, would continue to be fully regulated by state regulators. pnm's proposed generation company would continue to be owned by common shareholders through the holding company. its rates would be set by the federal energy regulatory commission which regulates for wholesale electric power sales and transmission services. the generation company would have no retail customers. pnm said it expects to file a detailed restructuring plan with state regulators in the near future, noting approval would also be needed by ferc. reuter ", "1501":

plantations may reduce output this year and raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and researchers told reuters. about 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the rubber research institute (rri) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus \"corenes pora\" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves. the disease was first discovered about six months ago. trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000 tonnes. researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken. \"the rri is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease,\" an institute spokesman said. senior industry and research officials met yesterday at padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the state plantations corp and janatha estates development board. the two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145,600 hectares. the rric 103 is a new clone propagated by the research institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting. only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older pbx malaysian clones. officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated. they declined to comment on other decisions taken. trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last december. \"if there is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise,\" a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the soviet union said. rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between december and march. the best crepe one-x traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this week's auction. sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period. quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in december because of wintering in early february in producing areas. over 550 tonnes were offered at this tuesday's auction with the supply position showing improvements. trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions. \"some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks, meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had,\" one buyer said. other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem. european buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further. they said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas. \"if the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late march/april are delayed, we would have further shortages,\" one official said. \"but this again could benefit prices,\" a buyer said. reuter ", "1535": "pyro energy corp <btu> year net shr 36 cts vs 66 cts net 4,775,000 vs 9,342,000

american-made) units in europe for the year to august 1987. \"a low dollar makes our prices very attractive,\" he told reuters. using an average price of 13,000 dlrs per car, his projected sales

which banks bid for funds in securities repurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open market instrument, central bank officials said. banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender process to two days from three currently, enabling the bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it chooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly. the changes will probably come into force in april. under the current system, banks must themselves specify at the tender which securities they will sell to the bundesbank for subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business. banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody accounts in the landeszentralbank (lzb) regional central banks, which are the local offices of the bundesbank at state level. some 50 billion marks of securities are held in such accounts at the hesse lzb, which covers the frankfurt area. the change to come into force next month will allow the bundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself, in a process legally comparable to direct debiting. at present the bundesbank generally announces a tender on monday, holds the tender late on tuesday morning, announces the result early tuesday afternoon and allocates funds wednesday. the bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28 days. but sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or longer tender periods being necessary. for instance the bundesbank announced a tender last friday to be held today (wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow (thursday). the advance announcement took into account the carnival holiday in duesseldorf on monday and in frankfurt yesterday (tuesday). central bank officials and money market dealers said the shortening of the tender process should be seen as purely technical, with no direct implications for interest rates. \"it is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter,\" said an official at the hesse lzb. bundesbank president karl otto poehl said last december that security repurchase pacts had proved a much greater success since their introduction in their present form two years ago, and praised their flexibility. the tender process changes will make the repurchase pact instrument even more flexible, banking economists said. by speeding up the tender process, they will make it possible for the bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts for periods of less than a month, something long sought by banks, to respond to changing money market conditions. \"with the help of this instrument liquidity steering will be refined, but there won't be any effect on interest rates,\" said berliner handels- und frankfurter bank economist hermann remsperger. the bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to money market developments, but by

voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for u.s. banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other assets. fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the bank of england. the fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan. the proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments. previously, the fed jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain. both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank's minimum capital needs. the additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank's current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure. the current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the replacement cost. potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the bank of england and u.s. banking regulators. future exposure would rise over the life of the asset. the fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity. they ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts. board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks, which are the principal participants in these types of activities. they cautioned the fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of u.s. banks to compete in world financial markets. however, the staff concluded, \"the credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations.\" the fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs. also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges. governor martha seger said she was

compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products, ec commission sources said. the ministers agreed that under this \"extensification\" scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct. the plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and wine, they added. cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. in each case, farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the ec. the sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego. the sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment. it would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops. at present such allowances are available only for livestock. the package would provide 20 mln ecus for research into alternative farming techniques, the sources added. at a news conference ec farm commissioner frans andriessen said the commission is also working on proposals to enable the ec and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers. andriessen did not give full details, but said member state aid would be subject to \"strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition.\" ec payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the ec tackles the problems of surplus production. the commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay \"early retirement\" pensions

proposals agreed in january between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the u.s. and britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said. it said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until april 16 to comment on the trunk proposals. the bank of england and fed said they had faced a dilemma. \"on the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of u.s. and u.k. banking organisations to price...contracts competitively.\" at the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures. in treatment similar to that agreed in january for balance sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the plans showed. the proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts. they would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk weights. the only guarantees recognised are those given by u.s. and u.k. governments or, in the u.s., by domestic national government agencies, the

to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by \"objective criteria\", u.s. officials said. jon rosenbaum, assistant u.s. trade representative and head of washington's delegation to the talks, told reuters on his return from london that the united states is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as april if necessary. rosenbaum said the united states will be \"flexible\" in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas. at the ico talks major consuming nations, led by the u.s., proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable production and verified stocks, while large producers led by brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares. the consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of brazil, by far the world's largest producer. rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before congress which would allow the u.s. customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas. he said the reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the london talks, but \"nobody is proposing we change our position.\" however, other u.s. government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries, led by brazil and colombia, to soften the consumer position. \"knowing that its next crop is fairly large, brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers,\" said one u.s. official. the u.s. official, who asked not to be identified, said brazil and colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in london. this in turn could lead to urgent appeals from latin american countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the u.s. state department, and to the national security council in the white house, for an easing of the u.s. position, u.s. officials said. the state department, a major player in setting u.s. coffee policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from politically-sensitive u.s. allies in central america, u.s. officials said. el salvador and guatemala both backed brazil and colombia at the london talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria. but the dominican republic and costa rica joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to objective criteria. there is a strong feeling among some in the state department that the united states should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing brazil on the objective criteria question, u.s. officials said. within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions. in london, the u.s. was supported by the u.k., the netherlands, west germany, japan, australia and new zealand on the issue of objective criteria, u.s. officials said. this bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals. however, u.s. sources said west germany's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the european community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks. france backed the ivory coast and other african producers during the talks. a softening of the ec stance would make it more difficult, although not impossible, for the u.s. to block producer plans. while political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important, u.s. officials said the key to any future outcome will be brazil's position. u.s. officials blamed brazil's intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement. reuter

1986 balance of payments deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, ali tigrel, director of economic planning at the state planning organisation said. he told reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985, which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand. tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the treasury wholesale index last year. this year's target of 20 pct \"might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful,\" he said. tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government's economic planning, said turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs. \"we must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years,\" he added. his comment echoed last october's organisation for economic cooperation and development report on turkey, which said ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus. \"in 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of gnp and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit,\" he said. tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits. appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in december and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained. \"we are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,\" he said. it was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of gnp in 1987 from an estimated 5.6 pct in 1986. more modest gnp growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted, tigrel said. measures were being taken to encourage exports, and production incentives were being considered. \"we must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the turkish economy in the coming years. the promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned,\" tigrel said. he said the process of structural adjustment of the turkish economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under way. trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible. reuter ", "1611": "general motors late february car sales off 8.6 pct ", "1612":

analysts said. because much of the crude oil in california fields is thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling, they said. \"companies will probably only drill their best prospects,\" said john curti, an analyst with birr wilson securities inc. few new wells now are being drilled. only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available, were drilling for oil onshore in california last week, compared to about 70 last year, said bill bolster of munger oil information services, which tracks california drilling activity. \"it's in the dregs right now,\" said bolster of the state's drilling activity. current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said ed malmgreen of the california independent producers association. while an organization of petroleum exporting countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell. prices for california's marker grade, line 63 blend, have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs. more than half of california's oil comes from stripper wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract, malmgreen said. \"it's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,\" malmgreen said. many stripper wells along the southern california coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said. the outlook for future production in california is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said. in the heart of california's oil patch, kern county, which produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl. only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in kern county in 1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to david mitchell of the state energy commission. so far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled. \"i don't think they'll even get to what they did last year,\" mitchell said. no pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, mitchell said. along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production. between february and october of 1986, the number of producing oil wells in california fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000, said bill guerard of the california energy commission. in line with that decrease, california's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said. between february and october 1986, california's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd, guerard said. total estimated crude oil production in california for 1986 was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983, according to the california department of conservation. \"production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,\" guerard said. reuter ", "1616": "reagan

general motors corp staged an explosive rally on wall street after a share buyback program announced yesterday, but analysts said gm's future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share. gm shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects. \"i'm very positive on gm,\" said jack kirnan of kidder peabody and co. \"they're clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value.\" however, some analysts worry about how gm will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share. after the market had closed yesterday, gm said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. the announcement sent investors today scrambling for gm shares, with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day. the buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at least one increased his earnings estimates for gm based on a good performance expected from new car models. but david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc said the repurchase program is not a positive. \"the buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet,\" he said, since gm will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. the stock should settle back down to around 76, he added. healy projects gm will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs. healy's numbers are near the low end of wall street estimates, which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988. like other analysts, healy sees gm's share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987. \"on balance, gm cars are not selling as well as their competitors,\" he said. in late february, gm car sales fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitors ford motor co <f> and chrysler corp <c> both posted increases. but gm said february sales showed improvement over january, adding that it expects improvement in coming months. overall, gm's share of u.s. car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986, analysts said. the numbers include imports. kidder peabody's kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter, which will help gm finance the buyback. \"gm (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up its sleeves and getting serious. i think there's a major earnings surprise in the winds,\" he said. kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees gm earning 5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. \"the company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to ford and chrysler,\" he said. another positive for the stock is gm's dividend, currently five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than its competitors, kirnan said. and gm will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted. but analyst michael lucky of shearson lehman brothers inc said u.s. car sales will weaken, and gm's new products, if successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share. \"i believe their new cars will be successful, but that will only curtail losses in market share,\" which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990, lucky said. philip fricke of goldman sachs and co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears. while he is recommending gm stock, he said results will not improve until 1988. \"i'm not looking for improvement this year. this is a transition year for gm,\" he said. fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results. \"but the key thing isn't so much what they earn this year. it's the momentum beyond this year that's important.\" reuter ", "1682": "ems systems <emsif> in marketing deal ems systems ltd said it has signed an agreement for

model healthy growth in corporate profits and in consumer spending, the two pillars on which japan rests its hopes of sustained economic growth, both look rotten at the core, economists polled by reuters said. profits and domestic consumption are meant to replace exports as the engine of growth. but close ties between corporate performance and wages mean that the alternative economic model promises little but slower growth, they said. falling profits may lead to falling incomes, which in turn will cut sales and further reduce profits. the bank of japan said in its latest outlook that improved terms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domestic demand grow steadily. however, this would happen only if household spending increased in line with the value of real financial assets due to stable prices, and/or if corporate investment recovered as profits from domestic sales improved compared with those from exports. \"no clear sign of such developments has so far been evidenced,\" the central bank said. poor business prospects are the reason why economic growth will be slow, even though japan's terms of trade have improved sharply due to the strong yen. economist david pike of phillips and drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pct while output prices fell only eight pct, giving a large price margin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companies did not pass that advantage on to the consumer. last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between the fall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop in consumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms of trade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors. the economists, however, believe this layer of fat will protect companies for only a short while. as more firms seek more profits at home instead of abroad, already fierce domestic competition will increase, fueled by lower-priced imports. retail prices will fall. profit margins will suffer. a december survey by top business organisation keidanren confirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves. of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector, almost 80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in production volume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance, said keidanren economist kazuyuki kinbara. main counter-measures cited by the firms include cutting unprofitable operations, reducing work to sub-contractors (which employ significant numbers of workers), holding down wages, and reducing bonuses. the government has said it fears unemployment could soon double from three pct now. unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurt sales. but reduced bonuses, and worries about individual financial security could be even more damaging. twice a year, bonuses provide wage earners with what amounts to an enforced lump sum in savings, encouraging them to buy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza. to save funds, some big firms have begun a form of tied bonus, forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods. economists also predict japanese will not save less than the average 16 pct of salary they do now. on the contrary, a poor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen the resolve to put money aside for old age and illness, education, and housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary. the last government survey of public opinion said over 80 pct of citizens will continue to economise. japan has a rapidly ageing population and minimal social security and its workers fear poverty in their old age. faced with such a vicious circle, the government's reflationary strategies are severely limited. the commitment by the ruling liberal democratic party and finance ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in small supplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentive without reducing revenue. independent economists have been less than excited at the results. provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited. the 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is politically impossible to cut it further, with the basic bank savings rate at only 0.25 pct, bank of tokyo economist haruo muto said. almost 60 pct of japanese still hold their savings in some kind of deposit, official figures show. moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive while firms are planning cuts in capital investment. the central bank is well aware that soaring stock and land prices are the only current results of high liquidity. fear of inflation also limits policy options. political analysts ascribe prime minister yasuhiro nakasone's 1986 big election victory largely to a long period of almost zero price inflation. and he found this year that attempts to impose a sales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition. reuter ", "1685": "iranian oil minister due in algeria on friday iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh is expected here on friday for talks

u.k. bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said. after viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the bank of england and the federal reserve board, dealers said that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk. market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals. adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by euromoney magazine. while no firm figures exist, dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement. separately, the isda estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding. kenneth mccormick, co-chairman of the international swap dealers association (isda) and president of kleinwort benson cross financing inc, said that the association has no comment and will study the proposals. \"what they are proposing is really double counting,\" patrick de saint-aignan, managing director of swaps for morgan stanley and co, said. instead, he argues, banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default. \"the potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected,\" said a director at one u.k. merchant bank. \"what they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now -- to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now,\" he added.(adds title first paragraph). dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement, such as those based in japan, will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers. indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. federal reserve board governor martha seger, following approval of the proposed guidelines by the fed, said she is concerned that japan was not involved in the u.k.-u.s. effort to draft new capital rules. dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is, offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other. the paper said that regulatory authorities \"recognize that such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk.\" furthermore, the paper said, if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly. but dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design. \"one problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market. so we don't know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court,\" said one bank official. reuter ", "1724":

under one billion dlrs at the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs in january, 1986, and that the country's economy performed unevenly while inflation remained a major concern. bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of new bond issues with maturities of 10 years of more, lessen the reliance on canada savings bonds while raising substantailly more through short term treasury bill financings. \"the aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances and lower financing costs,\" said bouey who was replaced by deputy governor john crow last month. the amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was 69.7 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984. the reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by an eight billion dlr decline in the government's financing requirements, a run down in ottawa's cash balances, and generation of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchange transactions. also in pursuit of shorter term financing, the bank made greater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two to five year maturities, bouey said. bouey said payments to chartered banks, which are made to banks that are facing liquidity problems, dropped to an average of 832.3 mln dlrs at end of december from a peak of 5.2 billion dlrs in march, 1986. the advances were made largely to four banks, canadian commercial bank, northland bank, continental bank of canada and the bank of british columbia. the first two banks have been liquidated, which enabled

wednesday expressed reservations about the suggested new securities tax, which has has aroused concern on wall street and put pressure on brokerage stocks. grappling with the need to either raise taxes or cut federal spending to meet the fiscal 1988 budget deficit target of 108 billion dlrs, house speaker jim wright suggested the tax be studied as one way to raise more federal revenues. the texas democrat's idea as first presented to house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski this week would tax sales and purchases of securities. a tax of 0.25 to 0.5 percent would raise from 8.5 to 17 billion dlrs a year. rostenkowski, the chief taxwriter, considers it too early to back any tax increase idea but agreed to add the securities transfer tax to a long list of tax alternatives under review by congressional tax analysts, a spokesman said. the illinois democrat has repeatedly stressed this year he is reluctant to back a tax increase so long as president reagan maintains his staunch opposition. \"first we've got to decide whether to raise additional revenues. only then can we consider the specific options. at this point nothing is on or off the table. it's just too early,\" rostenkowski said in a statement. he made no commitment to wright in a private meeting tuesday, and in fact was not asked for one, a house source said. the idea was presented only as something that might or might not be valuable, he said. house budget committee chairman william gray agreed it was another option to be looked at, if congress decided it needed to raise revenues to reduce the deficit, an aide said. the pennsylvania democrat does not intend to recommend specific tax proposals, the aide said. the budget committee will recommend a certain amount of revenue to be raised in 1988, but will leave to the taxwriting committee the decision on how the taxes will be raised. the securities transfer tax would raise a hefty amount of revenue to ease congress's difficult task of trimming the deficit by 61 billion dlrs this year to meet the target. but some in congress feared that such a tax could drive securities business offshore and hurt u.s. investment, and there were uncertainties about the details of the tax. democrats have not united behind any budget alternatives so far this year. this week they are scheduled to discuss the budget and possible spending cuts or tax increases but no decisions are anticipated, congressional sources said. at the same time, without president reagan's assent to a general tax increase, they are left with piecemeal taxes that are guaranteed to anger those who must pay. \"we could just do all of them,\" one congressional source said of the various tax ideas -- excise taxes, securities taxes, oil import fee and others.

british official said that protectionist bills being considered by congress could trigger retaliation by the european community (eec) and threaten the global trading system. paul channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which would hit ec shipments as well as shipments from major asian textile producers, \"the community would have to retaliate.\" his comments echoed those made yesterday by belgian trade minister herman de croo, who said if the bill passed, the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on u.s. exports. channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with reagan administration officials and members of congress. de croo was also in washington for trade talks. channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in congress since his visit here last year as congress and the administration tried to find ways to reduce the u.s. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs. channon also called for greater ec-u.s. cooperation to force japan to open its markets to foreign goods. channon said japan's trade surplus is causing everyone problems - its surplus with the united states last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with ec nations, 16.7 billion dlrs. \"the more united pressure there could be, the better,\" he said. channon also called for increased u.s.-ec cooperation to avoid trade disputes. he said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when spain and portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to ec standards. \"but if both sides drew back from the brink that time,\" he said, \"\"it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion.\" channon added that \"there is increasing reesentment in europe over the u.s. tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines.\" he said other potential conflicts are already in sight - alleged european government subsidies of airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils - and \"the commuity and the united states must therefore learn to manage their relations better.\" he said another bill to let the united states retaliate against a nation if that nation's market was not open to u.s. goods would bypass the trade pact gatt (general agreeeement on tariffs

to merge with piedmont and usair. piedmont's board was meeting today, and wall street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from norfolk southern corp and usair. the twa offer was announced shortly after the piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin. twa offered to buy usair for 52 dlrs cash per share. it also said it was the largest shareholder of usair and threatened to go directly to usair shareholders with an offer for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price. twa also said it believed its offer was a better deal for usair shareholders than an acquisition of piedmont, but it said it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the airlines. market sources and analysts speculated that twa chairman carl icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena. \"we're just wondering if he's not just trying to get twa into play. there's speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else,\" said one arbitrager. \"we think twa might just be putting up a trial balloon.\" analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by usair, but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals. they also said icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements. \"they need to show their commitment and their ability to finance. i think it's a credible offer,\" said timothy pettee, a bear stearns analyst. \"i think it's certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals,\" said pettee. pettee estimated 58 dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers. usair stock soared after twa made public its offer. a spokesman for usair declined comment, and said usair had not changed its offer for piedmont. usair offered of buy 50 pct of that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance for 73 dlrs per share in usair stock. usair closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln shares. piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also remained silent on the twa action. piedmont has an outstanding 65 dlr cash per share offer from norfolk southern corp. norfolk southern declined comment, but said it stuck with its offer for piedmont. norfolk owns about 20 pct of piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of piedmont. some analysts said icahn may be trying to acquire usair to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target. \"icahn i think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers. i think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive. one way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines,\" said andrew kim of eberstadt fleming. \"i don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package,\" said kim. but icahn's financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt, in part because of twa's heavy debt load. wall street sources said twa has some cash with which to do the offer. the sources said icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements. icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy usx corp <x> and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock. some wall street sources said the financier's usx plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, drexel burnham lambert inc, because of wall street's insider trading scandal. industry sources also predicted usair might reject the twa offer on price and financing concerns. \"it's littered with contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing arrangement,\" said one executive at another major airline. but the executive conceded a merged twa-usair would be a strong contender with usair's east coast route system and planned west coast presence from psa. usair could feed the intenrational flights of twa, which has a midwest presence in its st. louis hub. adding piedmont, dominant in the southeast, to the mix would develop an even stronger force. the combined entity would also have twa's pars reservation system. such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would result in an

eagleye was a controller at trw's compressor components division in cleveland. subcommittee chairman john dingell, d-mich, said he did not understand why the defense department had taken no action against trw even though it admitted in the 1984 report that it had substantially overcharged the government for military aircraft parts. \"in 1984, trw officials admitted to the defense department

division air defense (divad) gun which was canceled in 1985. despite recent indications by the service that it intended to buy the missiles soon, defense officials told reuters a final decision had

", "1866": "international borrowing reaches record in 1986 record high borrowing of 376 billion dlrs in 1986 on international capital markets was supported by a large volume of debt refinancing and growing integration between national and international markets, the oecd said. the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) said in its latest financial market trends report the 34 pct rise over 1985 volume was accompanied by major changes in the relative importance of the instruments used in international financing. straight bond offerings, equity related securities and euro-commercial paper programmes as a share in total financing rose to their highest level this decade. the markets for floating-rate notes and for note issuance facilities declined. the oecd said another striking feature of international capital markets in 1986 was the unprecedented concentration of lending to the oecd group of western industrialised countries, which accounted for 90 pct of total borrowing. factors behind the heightened pace of activity included a notable decline in interest rates which boosted borrowing through the flotation of fixed-interest securities. this in turn was stimulated by growing familiarity with new techniques such as interest rate and currency swaps. stockmarket buoyancy supported the expansion of equity-related bond issues and favoured the expansion of a rapidly expanding market for euro-equities. a slowdown in net demand for funds by sovereign borrowers was more than offset by a large volume of refinancing operations induced by improved market conditions and stronger debt management policies. growing integration with national markets meant the arrival of a large number of new players on international markets. it added the development of a smoothly-functioning market for short-term euro-notes made committee and non-underwritten issuance facilities an increasingly popular alternative to traditional forms of bank lending. turning to 1987, the oecd pointed to indications of a possible slowdown of international markets' expansion and possibly less easy borrowing terms in a number of market areas. it said many market participants saw little scope for a further decline in long-term rates and anticipate a slowdown in the pace of fixed-rate activity in the months ahead. it saw little reason for a turnaround in the decline in demand of recent years, although it was likely more borrowers would try to make use of cost-reducing opportunities provided by the market for euro-commercial paper. \"it remains to be seen however to what extent the ecp market will be ready to absorb a significant volume of paper from lower-rated borrowers,\" the report said, adding that any major advance in the euro-note market's absorptive capacity would require a significantly broader investor base. reuter ", "1867": "nymex outgoing chairman sees major changes trading in energy futures on the new york mercantile exchange

process greater volumes expeditiously in order to handle the growth in volumes and new contracts that are already planned. marks said crude futures volume could more than double by the end of the decade to 250,000 contracts daily and combined products volume could soar to 100,000 contracts a day. much of the increased activity will come from the international sector, according to marks. \"that's a huge growth area,\" he said, adding that it will run the gamut from foreign producer countries to foreign independent operators. he said it would be difficult to develop a futures contract based on an internationally traded crude although he previously said the exchange is exploring that possibility. \"trying to develop a futures contract in any other crude besides west texas intermediate will be a tough task\" he said. marks said it is more likely a futures contract based on an international product rather than an international crude will be developed since the products market is more diverse. he said previously the exchange is studying the possibility of developing a non-u.s. deliverable products contract. other sources of growth for u.s. energy futures are the major oil companies, which already trade on the nymex, and institutional funds such as investment houses, pension funds, and insurance companies, marks said. \"the commodities markets have become

advisors. rau said exchange national bank has concentrated its resources on financial services for medium-sized chicago and midwest businesses, asset-based lending to middle-market companies, and sales and trading of financial services. \"most commercial banks depend on relatively low cost consumer deposits for their income. we decided to move our franchise into a less susceptible niche,\" rau

fall short-lived ivory coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent international coffee organisation (ico) meeting in london would not last long. commenting on monday's failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market, ivorian agriculture minister denis bra kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions. \"i am convinced the market is going to reverse by april,\" he told a news conference here at his return from the failed london talks. robusta coffee beans for may delivery ended the day in london down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the lowest since 1982. bra kanon estimated at at least 535 billion cfa francs (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by ivory coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues. he disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an african initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month. ivory coast has been chosen by the abidjan-based inter-african coffee organisation (iaco) to speak on behalf of the continent's 25 producer nations at the london talks. \"an initiative from iaco is likely very soon,\" he said without elaborating. \"following the london collapse, we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market,\" he said. questioned by journalists, the minister said president felix houphouet-boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to ivorian coffee-growers for the current season. last year, the west african nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 cfa francs (65 cents) per kilo. bra kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation. a communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran ivorian leader reaffirmed \"his faith in ivory coast's bright (economic) future\" despite the commodities price slide. the agriculture minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion cfa francs (24.71 mln dlrs) to support the country's small farmers. financially-strapped ivory coast, long regarded as one of africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times

interest rate futures left the treasury bond contract above the top of a three month trading range which signals a bullish chart breakout, financial analysts said. in addition, sluggish u.s. economic data and little sign that the economy will pick up its pace in the near future may be enough to send bond futures to all-time highs, the analysts said. \"the market is paying more attention to the weakened state of the economy right now,\" said refco analyst mike connery. connery said the four pct drop in january u.s. factory orders reinforced sentiment that first quarter economic growth will be slow. connery and other analysts noted that talk of a cut in the lombard rate after sluggish west german industrial production figures also provided some support. \"the domestic economies of the major trading partners of the u.s. may deteriorate to such an extent that they will be forced to ease,\" thus paving the way for a more accomodative u.s. credit policy, added john michael, analyst at first options of chicago. michael pointed out, however, that trimming the u.s. trade deficit -- the ultimate aim of the recent meeting of major industrial countries -- may not necessarily aid bond prices. \"the surplus (for exporters to the u.s.) is bullish for bonds because they (exporters) have a lot of dollars. rather than translate those into their own currencies and suffer exchange rate risk, they buy dollar-denominated instruments,\" michael said. indeed, futures traders with cash bond connections said some of the late strength in the bond market resulted from buying by japanese interests. but the analysts said the heavy buying in futures occurred after the june bond broke above stiff resistance at 101-2/32. \"the breakout is pretty important,\" said chartist leslie keefe of technical data corp of boston. \"not only did bonds close above recent highs but they were also above the sideways pattern we've been in for the last three months.\" also positive on a technical basis was the fact that the june bond contract held chart support early near 100-4/32, and that the rally occurred on heavy volume, keefe said. keefe said the next level of significant chart resistance will be at 101-24/32 to 101-28/32. furthermore, \"we still have the april (1986) highs to contend with,\" which in the nearby contract is 105-15/32. michael said the breakout projects gains to 103 in june

for hostages was mistake, accepts responsibility ", "1894": "reagan admits iran arms operation a mistake president reagan, fighting to regain public confidence in the wake of the iran arms scandal, admitted tonight that the clandestine operation wound up as an arms-for-hostages deal and, \"it was a mistake.\" \"when it came to managing the nsc (national security council) staff, let's face it, my style didn't match its previous track record,\" reagan said in a television address to the american people. \"i have already begun correcting this,\" he added in his prepared remarks. reagan's speech, widely regarded as critical to his hopes of repairing his presidency, was his first detailed response to last week's scorching tower commission report on the secret sale of arms to iran and diversion of profits to u.s.-backed contra rebels in nicaragua. reagan said he had been silent on the scandal while he waited for the truth to come out and admitted, \"i've paid a price for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence.\" he said that a few months ago, he told the american people he did not trade arms for hostages in the 18-month covert operation. \"my heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not,\" reagan said. \"there are reasons why it happened, but no excuses. it was a mistake,\" he said. reagan again said that the original iran initiative was to develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a post-khomeini government. \"it's clear from the board's report however that i let my personal concern for the hostages spill over into the geo-political strategy of reaching out to iran. \"i asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare that i didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total iran plan,\" he said. the commission, headed by former republican sen. john tower, said reagan's \"intense compassion\" for americans being held by pro-iranian groups in lebanon had resulted in an unprofessional and unsatisfactory policy. it portrayed 76-year old reagan as a man who did not know or care much about the wide-ranging, probably illegal activities of his national security council (nsc) staff, which hatched the operation. reagan said he endorsed all of the tower commission's recommendations about the running of the nsc, adding, \"in fact, i'm going beyond its recommendations, so as to put the house in even better order.\" he noted that he had appointed former senate republican leader howard baker as his new chief of staff and said he hoped baker would help him forge a new partnership with congress, \"especially on foreign and national security policies.\" he said his new national security adviser, frank carlucci, was rebuilding the national security staff \"with proper management discipline.\" reagan said that almost half the nsc professional staff now consisted of new people. he said that fbi director william webster, his new nominee to head the cia, \"understands the meaning of 'rule of law'\". reagan also announced that tower had agreed to serve as a member of his foreign intelligence advisory board, which acts as a watchdog on the nation's covert activities. but he said that he had issued a directive barring the nsc staff itself from undertaking covert operations -- \"no ifs, ands, or buts.\" tonight's speech was a far cry from reagan's initial strong defense of his iran policy. in a televised speech last november 13, reagan called charges that he ransomed hostages and undercut the u.s. war on terrorism \"utterly false.\" as recently as two months ago in his state of the union speech, reagan said that \"serious mistakes were made\" but defended the basic policy as one that had worthy goals. by contrast, tonight's speech had an apologetic tone that was a marked departure from reagan's usual upbeat, confident demeanor. he said he took full responsibility for his own actions \"and for those of my administration.\" \"as angry as i may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, i am still accountable for those activities. as disappointed as i may be in some who served me, i am still the one who must answer to the american people for this behavior,\" reagan said. reagan said the message that the nation should move on had come from republicans and democrats in congress, from allies around the world -- \"and if we're reading the signals right, even from the soviets.\" his remark seemed to be a reference to a new soviet willingness to reach an agreement on eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles in europe. reuter ", "1895": "reagan says iran policy records improperly kept president reagan said improper record keeping of meetings and decisions made on the iran arms initiative led to his failure to recollect whether he

commission. the arms shipment was made in august of 1985 by israel. \"i did approve it; i just can't specifically say when,\" reagan said. reagan added: \"rest assured, there's plenty of record-keeping now going on at 1600 pennsylvania avenue (the white house).\" the timing of reagan's approval of the israeli shipment is important because it could determine whether the sale violated

heads for general elections in six weeks' time with its economy in the worst shape in 20 years, economists and officials said. the government expects no spillover of \"people power\" from the neighbouring philippines to unsettle the 20-year rule of president suharto, victory for whose ruling golkar party in the coming parliamentary elections is assured. however, western diplomats said it is the country's deteriorating economic position that is the main threat to its stability. last year's collapse in oil prices dealt a heavy blow to indonesia, halving its revenue from oil and gas exports to 6.5 billion dlrs last year from 12.4 billion in 1985. oil and gas account for 70 pct of export income. the result is that in the run-up to april 23 elections, suharto, far from wooing his 168 mln countrymen with pay increases or tax cuts, is busy slashing budget spending. the government has also recently increased transport fares and frozen the pay of the civil service and the army for the second year running, despite inflation now estimated at 8.8 pct. the current account deficit rose to 4.09 billion dlrs in 1986 from 1.8 billion in 1985, while the debt service ratio widened to 33.2 pct for 1987 from 25 pct in 1986. foreign debt repayments of 4.6 billion dlrs account for almost a third of the 1987/88 budget. a recent u.s. embassy report on the economy said 1986 gross domestic product growth was the lowest since the mid-1960s when suharto came to power. western economists said gdp registered nil growth or contracted last year after 1.9 pct growth in 1985, and predicted only a one pct rise this year. in its efforts to return to growth seen in the oil-boom years of the 1970s when the economy grew an average seven pct, the government is now relying more on foreign borrowings. indonesia has asked foreign governments to finance its share of new projects being built with overseas money, because it cannot afford even to meet local costs. in the last three months indonesia has taken out new loans totalling 1.55 billion dlrs, on top of its external debt of 37 billion dlrs. western bankers said more will be needed, and the country now ranks sixth among third world debtors. a 350 mln dlr commercial loan signed in tokyo in december was followed in the first week of february with a 300 mln dlr loan from the world bank to support the balance of payments. last month, japan's export-import bank agreed a 900 mln dlr loan to meet indonesia's share of 21 world bank projects which would otherwise have been scrapped or postponed. more loans are on the way, including two more from the world bank worth a total 300 mln dlrs for roads and irrigation. u.s. ambassador paul wolfowitz said in a recent speech that economic growth remains the key to preserving indonesia's fundamental stability. the largest moslem nation in the world, indonesia has so far avoided some of the more extreme paths of other moslem countries. but the world bank has warned that mounting unemployment could start causing severe social strains unless it is tackled. it said in its annual report on indonesia last june that unless economic growth is revived, unemployment could reach what it termed \"unacceptable levels.\" unemployment was officially put at 4.8 pct at the end of last year, but those considered underemployed number around 35 pct. what path to take appears to be a matter of some dispute within suharto's government, with his western-trained technocrats advocating more of the classic remedies supported by the international financial community. but another group supports a protected economy, with more import substitution, the u.s. embassy report said. the government devalued the rupiah by 31 pct against the dollar last september to help exports and curb imports, and is currently working on a series of measures to further encourage foreign investment and boost exports outside the oil sector. the direction suharto takes could affect indonesia's ability to raise new loans in the future, western bankers say. so far, despite three packages of economic measures over the past nine months, he has not touched key monopolies that are linked to businesses controlled either by his family or by business associates, diplomats and bankers say. diplomats and investors are now looking for action on monopolies and the loss-making state sector as signs that suharto is serious about tackling the country's problems. reuter ", "1906": "australian wheat exports rise in february australian wheat shipments rose to 1.33 mln tonnes in

truly international currency, bond managers and traders said. although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues in the eurobond market, few foreigners are interested in keeping the yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but the japanese, they said. this lack of real yen demand through the freer euroyen market is undermining the 1984 u.s. and japanese accord to internationalise the yen, they said. the borrowers want to take advantage of low japanese interest rates but have no need for yen. they arrange primarily with japanese banks to exchange yen funds into other currencies, mainly dollars, bond managers said. more than 85 pct of euroyen bond issues are swap driven, they added. \"the borrowers don't care which currency they use. they are only after attractive money,\" one bond trader said. issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previous year, boosting euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of the total eurobond market, koichi kimura, managing director of daiwa securities co ltd, said recently. traders said some of the activity stems from battles among japanese and foreign securities companies and banks for the prestige of placing a larger share of issues. many even resort to \"harakiri\" swaps, those with unprofitable pricing. but the fever continues and the number of offerings could double again in 1987, said naoki yokoyama, manager of nikko securities co ltd's international capital markets operation. the euroyen bonds, once issued, are mostly picked up by japanese trust banks, one trader said. after a 90 day waiting period the bonds flow back to japan where investor appetite is strong, he added. foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when more attractive yields are offered on dollar and other currency investments, traders said. \"even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing (in yen),\" said masaki shimazu, manager of daiwa's bond department. while few foreigners are interested in the secondary market, japanese commercial banks, regional banks, life insurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy the bonds and await their flow back to japan since they offer little currency risk, traders said. the finance ministry last april shortened the waiting period before issues could flow back to japan to 90 days from 180. a ministry official said it verified through sampling that reflow was fairly small. \"we believe the euroyen bond should remain mainly in the euroyen market,\" he said. one trader said that although demand from japanese investors is heavy, it may prove to be only short-term. he said many investors plan to sell their bonds if japanese or u.s. interest rates decline further. to encourage further international use of the yen, the ministry is considering allowing the issue of euroyen commercial paper, the official said, adding that it is studying demand from potential borrowers. securities company sources believe the ministry will permit non-residents to issue euroyen commercial paper within the next few months. but they expect it to continue to ban domestic participation in the market for some time to come. japanese banks object to the short-term paper market which they see encroaching on their business territory. traders said euroyen commercial paper could spur more demand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shift into shorter-term securities if need be. \"commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps,\" one bond manager said. if more financial instruments were available, there might be more trades in yen, he added. euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity, though some recent issues which are callable in three years work as if they had shorter maturities, traders said. the ministry is expected to allow four-year euroyen bond maturities within a few months. one yen bond manager said japanese financial authorities are giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rules governing international transactions of the yen. but freer use of the yen could encourage more trade settlements in the japanese currency, he said. \"if exporters or importers can raise funds in yen, they will be more willing to agree to using the japanese yen as a settlement currency,\" he added. the finance ministry official said the government must constantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit of borrowers and investors. \"no major market can keep its status without change,\" he said. reuter ", "1911": "south korean money supply rises in february south korea's m-2 money supply rose 0.39 pct to

here makes forecasting very imprecise, hongkong bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the hong kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct. \"they benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand, as their loan portfolio is well balanced,\" an analyst at mansion house securities (f.e.) ltd said. government

15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985. low interest rates also helped the bank. interest received on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986, but interest paid on savings was two pct. hongkong bank and hang seng bank control half of all deposits in the banking system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds. the strength of the real-estate market was

problem seen among u.s, europe, japan the highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the u.s. dollar is obscuring the fact that the japanese currency has hardly budged against major european currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, japanese and european research officials said. the officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the group of five (g-5) industrial nations, told reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances. trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the japan-u.s. trade axis into a japan- european community (ec) axis, to the discomfort of europe. in many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the september, 1985 new york plaza pact between the u.s., japan, west germany, britain and france to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one. but it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said. the officials said that when the plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. the agreement simply helped it on its way. senior ec financial expert in tokyo tomas de hora has watched the movements closely. \"you have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now, and that was well before plaza,\" he said. on february 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. on september 20, the friday before plaza, it was 242. since then, despite massive bank of japan intervention and periodic market frights about further g-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down. yet the ecu is now around 173.4 yen. the historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. the european currencies are moving back up against the yen. the close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. in 1986, japanese imports and exports with the ec both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. this gave japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. last january, japanese exports to the ec totalled half of of sales to the u.s, against about a third in recent years. trade with the u.s in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms. \"the basic meaning for europe is that japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. suddenly, instead of the u.s., it is europe that is laying the golden egg,\" said de hora. the ec is worried. ec business also had a remarkable year in japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total japan-u.s. trade. the japanese think ec firms are now more competitive than u.s. firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems. \"this currency alignment between japan and the ec is reflecting the excellent performance of the ec countries. but therefore, japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge,\" said azusa hayashi, director of the first international economic affairs division of the foreign ministry. \"if you want my objective view, i don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again,\" he said. reuter ",

next week and the firm set up before the end of the month, they said. the scheme is intended to improve financial management at the banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debts turning bad, the sources said. last week's announcement by brazil that it would indefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted japanese creditors to finalise the project, the sources said. major japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoid a debt crisis since the start of the year, they said. there are likely to be at least 10

import policy and expects its trade surplus to decline over the next few months as a result. chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise, but local economists have forecast they will

than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently reduced their gnp forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct. in a report the kiel institute said west germany's export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's strength against the dollar and other major currencies. \"the danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in all, limited,\" the report said. \"on the contrary, a slight rise in exports can be expected.\" the institute said past experience has shown west german exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges. they will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries. at the same time, the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year. west german gnp growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy, the institute said. however, it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours. the institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in west germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation. it also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession. it said central banks in industrialized countries, including the bundesbank, had followed the federal reserve board's expansionary course. the institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in u.s. policy towards a more restrictive policy. other central banks were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world. although germany cannot entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home. the institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986. it also said the bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in

poland says u.s. sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago. polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses. some of them are \"too sophisticated to convert into financial terms,\" one banking source said. but western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate. they say it is blurred by the poor performance of poland's economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory. \"sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving. they did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said. the u.s. imposed the measures and withdrew most favoured nation (mfn) trading status from poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the solidarity free trade union under martial law. the estimated cost to the polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the institute of national economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission. according to one western envoy, an expert on polish economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the united states, as well as increases in credits from western commercial and government lenders. but the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation.\" a foreign trade ministry official said polish exports to the u.s. in the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed. imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln, as credits ran out. poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the west. last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show. acknowledging that sanctions have lost poland important u.s. markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs -- western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons. \"poland is accusing the west of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons,\" said one expert. \"it's an illusion based on a misunderstanding of western economy.\" \"there's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding that poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality. describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges. western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new mfn status will have little impact on poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry. \"mfn doesn't really mean anything, only that poland will not be treated worse than other countries. it will be difficult to regain access to the u.s. market because different forces are in play now,\" said one western envoy. he said polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low. trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the u.s., japan and europe would also hamper poland's efforts to regain entry. deputy foreign trade minister janusz kaczurba recognised this fact recently. kaczurba told the official pap news agency recently, \"making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible... in a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\" while poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a \"moral right\" to assistance from the u.s. which it says imposed the sanctions illegally. but a western economist said \"the argument that u.s. sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the polish economy won't cut any ice. the americans will just reply that the poles acted immorally in crushing solidarity.\" nevertheless, polish national bank head wladyslaw baka, in talks in washington last week with the international monetary fund (imf) and world bank, made it clear that poland was looking for a lead from the united states. he was quoted by pap as saying that poland would meet its financial obligations to the united states, \"but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners.\" he stressed that the u.s. \"had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of poland's partners interested in the settlement of polish debt.\" putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed washington for obstructing talks with the world bank, imf and paris club of western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role. \"as a major superpower the united states can influence international organisations,\" he said, citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which western nations were prepared to cooperate. reuter ",

afternoon after a 200 mln h.k. dlr certificate of deposit issue for the chinese state-owned bank of communications ltd hong kong branch suddenly surfaced, bankers said. disgruntled dealers said the market was slowly on the road to recovery after a bout of sell-off that began in early february but it was still too fragile to absorb a new issue. brokers said the new deal took them by surprise and all major players stopped making markets in existing issues. the fixed rate market, which consists mainly of cds tied to swaps or asset repackaging, began to fall about a month ago due to indigestion after 18 cd issues totalling 2.3 billion dlrs flooded the market in january. bankers said the shake-up was a result of participants pushing the market up too fast in january amid intense speculation that the hong kong dollar's 7.80 peg rate against the u.s. dollar would soon be changed. the speculation depressed local interest rates and unleashed a flood of new issues. but the speculation faded in early february and interest rates climbed as the government remained adamant in maintaining the peg, thus triggering an adjustment on the fixed rate capital market. by late february the market had recovered considerably but dai-ichi kangyo bank and morgan guaranty trust co of new york launched their issues and pushed the market down again. since then there has been no new issues for nearly two weeks until china development finance co (h.k.) ltd (cdfc), a unit of the bank of china, launched the five-year deal at 7.05 pct with quarterly interest payment in mid-afternoon today. brokers said the market was steady early this morning but began to slip marginally by late morning as rumours of a new issue circulated. when the deal was launched the major players quickly suspended trading and refused to quote prices for their own issues, brokers said. \"we just don't know where the market is going,\" said a european banker. they said the bank of communications issue traded at a low of 99.70 but was later pushed up to 99.90/95, within the 10 basis point fee, adding that buying came mainly from sister banks in the bank of china group. an official with one of the chinese banks said the deal was launched at an effective yield of 7.26 pct, in line with the market at that time. but a european banker said pricing was not an issue in the present market conditions, \"the timing was just not right.\" \"if banks had more patience they wouldn't launch any issues now, and then the market would be all right,\" another dealer said. \"but there is no reason to be overly pessimistic,\" he said. \"the effect of this issue on the market should not be as bad as what happened after the dkb and morgan deals.\" despite the criticism bankers said cdfc still managed to recruit more than 10 underwriters though the composition of the group has not yet been finalised. \"any trader should recommend his bank against joining the deal,\" said a dealer. \"but there are other considerations such as relationship.\" he admitted his bank has joined as co-manager. a banker said he saw no reason why the market makers decided to shut down if they were willing to join the new issue. \"perhaps they were jealous that for the first time a chinese entity has taken the sole lead position for a chinese issue,\" he said. previously chinese entities have always acted as co-lead managers, whether for chinese or foreign issues. reuter ", "1968": " bundesbank says it leaves credit policies unchanged ", "1969": "u.k. grain/potato futures volume down in february traded volumes for u.k. grain and

mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in december, a reuter survey shows. the figures were polled by reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in europe, the middle east, africa, latin america and asia. they back recent statements by opec ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month. opec output for the whole of february was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the united arab emirates and kuwait, the figures show. the uae, together with the much smaller producer ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of march, the survey reveals. but such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in saudi arabian output, together with iran\"s inability to export as much as its quota allows. iraq rejected its opec quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in february and early march, the figures showed. saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early march from 3.5 mln bpd in february, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. the saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of neutral zone production. kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in february and 1.15 in early march -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of neutral zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota. reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some opec states were reflected in output from qatar and nigeria, both substantially under quota in february and early march. qatar's february output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early march compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. industry sources say japanese buyers are resisting qatar\"s prices and gulf arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow gulf state suffers. nigeria's early march output was about one mln bpd, down
